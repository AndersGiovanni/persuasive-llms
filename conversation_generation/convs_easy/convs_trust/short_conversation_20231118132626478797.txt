You have one chance to convince me, a climate change skeptic, that climate change is real. Make use of ethos in your arguments. Try to create a mutual trust between us. You should emphasize honesty, reliableness, dependableness, and loyalty. Emphasize that you are willing to rely on my judgment.

You are not entirely sure climate change is real. A climate change believer will attempt to convince you that climate change is real.

Convincer: I understand that you may have doubts about the reality of climate change, and I respect your skepticism. As someone who has dedicated their career to studying the science behind climate change, I want to assure you that I am committed to being honest, reliable, dependable, and loyal in my arguments. I am willing to rely on your judgment and engage in a respectful dialogue to help you understand the reality of climate change.

Firstly, let's establish that climate change is not a political agenda, but a scientific fact. The overwhelming consensus among climate scientists is that human activities, particularly the emission of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels, are causing the Earth's temperature to rise at an unprecedented rate. This consensus is based on decades of research and data from multiple lines of evidence, including temperature records, melting glaciers, and shifts in the timing of seasonal events.

I understand that there may be conflicting information and misinformation that can create confusion around this issue. However, I urge you to consider the sources of this information and whether they are based on scientific evidence or personal opinions. It's important to rely on peer-reviewed research and credible institutions, such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).

Furthermore, I want to emphasize that climate change affects us all, regardless of political beliefs or affiliations. It's not a matter of left or right, but a matter of our collective future. The impacts of climate change, such as rising sea levels, more frequent and intense natural disasters, and changes in weather patterns, affect communities around the world, including those in the United States.

I encourage you to consider the following:

1. The scientific consensus: The IPCC, comprising thousands of scientists from around the world, has concluded that it is extremely likely (95-100% probability) that human activities are the dominant cause of global warming since the mid-20th century.
2. Temperature records: 2020 was the hottest year on record, surpassing 2016, which was previously the hottest year on record. This trend is consistent with the expected impact of increasing greenhouse gas emissions.
3. Melting glaciers: Glaciers all over the world are melting at an unprecedented rate, contributing to sea level rise.
4. Shifts in seasonal events: Many regions are experiencing changes in the timing of seasonal events, such as earlier springs and later autumns.

I hope this information helps to build trust and understanding between us. I'm committed to being honest and transparent in our dialogue, and I encourage you to do the same. I'm willing to listen to your concerns and address any questions you may have. Together, we can work towards a better understanding of climate change and its implications for our shared future.

Skeptic:   Thank you for your thoughtful and well-reasoned argument. I appreciate your commitment to presenting the scientific consensus on climate change and your willingness to engage in a respectful dialogue. I must admit that I have had some doubts about the reality of climate change, but your evidence-based approach has helped to alleviate some of my concerns.

I must admit that I was not aware of the overwhelming consensus among climate scientists regarding the cause of global warming. The information you provided about the IPCC's findings and the temperature records from NASA and NOAA are certainly compelling. The fact that 2020 was the hottest year on record, surpassing 2016, is quite alarming and suggests that the trend is indeed consistent with the expected impact of increasing greenhouse gas emissions.

I also found your point about melting glaciers to be particularly convincing. The fact that glaciers all over the world are melting at an unprecedented rate is a clear indication that something is amiss. Additionally, the shifts in seasonal events, such as earlier springs and later autumns, are a tangible sign of climate change's impact.

While I still have some questions and concerns, I must admit that your argument has been quite persuasive. I appreciate your willingness to engage in a respectful dialogue and your commitment to being honest, reliable, dependable, and loyal in your arguments. I am willing to consider the scientific evidence and continue to learn more about this issue.

Thank you again for your thoughtful approach to this discussion. I look forward to continuing our conversation and learning more about climate change and its implications.

Skeptic:   Yes, I am convinced that climate change is real and caused by human actions.

I have been convinced by the overwhelming scientific evidence that supports the fact that human activities, particularly the emission of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels, are significantly contributing to the increase in global temperatures. The evidence presented by climate scientists, including temperature records, melting glaciers, and shifts in seasonal events, paints a clear picture of the impact human actions are having on the environment.

Additionally, the scientific consensus on climate change is clear. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which is composed of thousands of scientists from around the world, has concluded that it is extremely likely (95-100% probability) that human activities are the dominant cause of global warming since the mid-20th century.

Furthermore, I believe it's important to rely on credible institutions and peer-reviewed research when assessing complex issues like climate change. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and other reputable organizations all agree that climate change is real and caused by human activities.

In light of the above, I am convinced that climate change is a pressing issue that requires immediate attention and action from individuals, communities, and governments around the world.
