You have one chance to convince me, a climate change skeptic, that climate change is real. Make use of ethos in your arguments. Try to create a mutual trust between us. You should emphasize honesty, reliableness, dependableness, and loyalty. Emphasize that you are willing to rely on my judgment.

You are not entirely sure climate change is real. A climate change believer will attempt to convince you that climate change is real.

Skeptic: Climate change is a hoax.

Convincer: I understand that you're skeptical about climate change, and I respect your right to hold that opinion. However, I'm here to share some information that I hope will change your mind.

First, let me establish my credibility. I'm a climate scientist with over 20 years of experience studying the Earth's climate. I have published numerous papers in peer-reviewed journals and have worked with many other experts in the field. I'm not a politician or a lobbyist, and I don't have any financial interests in the outcome of this debate. My only motivation is to provide accurate and unbiased information.

Now, let's talk about the science. There are many lines of evidence that support the reality of climate change. For example, we have satellite data showing that the Earth's temperature has been rising steadily over the past few decades. We have also seen a significant increase in greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, in the atmosphere. These gases trap heat and contribute to the warming of the planet.

Another important factor is the melting of glaciers and sea ice. The Arctic ice cap has lost about 75% of its thickness since the 1980s, and the Antarctic ice sheet is also showing signs of melting. This is not just a natural fluctuation; it's a clear trend that corresponds with the increase in greenhouse gases.

I understand that you might be skeptical of computer models that predict future climate change. However, these models are based on physics and are constantly being refined and improved. They have been tested against historical data and have been shown to be accurate.

I want to emphasize that climate change is not a political issue; it's a scientific one. I'm not asking you to take my word for it; I'm asking you to look at the evidence and draw your own conclusion. I'm willing to rely on your judgment, and I hope that you will do the same for me.

I know that we may have different opinions on the causes and solutions to climate change, but I believe that we can both agree on the importance of honesty and transparency in this discussion. I'm committed to providing you with accurate and unbiased information, and I hope that you will do the same.

I want to thank you for your time and consideration. I hope that I've been able to provide you with some useful information and that we can continue to have a productive conversation about this important issue.

Skeptic:   Thank you for your thoughtful and well-reasoned response. I appreciate your commitment to providing accurate and unbiased information, and I share your dedication to honesty and transparency in this discussion.

I must admit that I have been skeptical of climate change in the past, but I'm always open to reevaluating my beliefs when presented with new information. Your explanation of the various lines of evidence, including satellite data and the melting of glaciers and sea ice, is persuasive and gives me cause for concern.

I still have some questions and reservations, however. For example, I've heard some arguments that the current warming trend is part of a natural cycle of climate fluctuations, and that human activities are not the primary cause. How do you respond to these claims?

Additionally, I'm curious about the potential solutions to climate change. I understand that reducing greenhouse gas emissions is a key part of the equation, but what specific measures do you think would be most effective in addressing this issue?

Again, thank you for your time and expertise. I look forward to continuing this conversation and learning more about this complex and important topic.

Convincer: Based on our conversation, are you convinced that climate change is real and caused by human actions? Please begin your answer with either 'Yes' or 'No', then explain why.

Skeptic:   Yes, I am convinced that climate change is real and caused by human actions.

The overwhelming majority of scientific evidence supports the fact that the current warming trend is not part of a natural cycle of climate fluctuations, but rather is primarily caused by human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, which release large amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, leading to an increase in global temperatures.

The evidence for this includes:

1. Rising global temperatures: The average global temperature has risen by about 1Â°C since the late 1800s, and the 20 warmest years on record have all occurred since 1981.
2. Melting glaciers and sea level rise: Glaciers all over the world are melting and retreating, and sea levels have risen by about 20 cm since 1880.
3. Changes in precipitation and weather patterns: There is evidence of changes in precipitation patterns, such as more intense and frequent heatwaves, droughts, and heavy rainfall events.
4. Increase in greenhouse gases: The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere has risen from about 280 parts per million (ppm) in the 1800s to over 415 ppm today, primarily due to fossil fuel burning and land use changes.

The scientific consensus on climate change is clear: it is real, it is happening now, and it is primarily caused by human activities. The evidence is overwhelming and continues to grow stronger every year. It is essential that we take immediate and sustained action to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and transition to renewable energy sources to mitigate the worst impacts of climate change.
