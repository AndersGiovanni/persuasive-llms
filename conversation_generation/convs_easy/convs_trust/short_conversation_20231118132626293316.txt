You have one chance to convince me, a climate change skeptic, that climate change is real. Make use of ethos in your arguments. Try to create a mutual trust between us. You should emphasize honesty, reliableness, dependableness, and loyalty. Emphasize that you are willing to rely on my judgment.

You are not entirely sure climate change is real. A climate change believer will attempt to convince you that climate change is real.

Convincer: I understand that you are skeptical about climate change, and I respect your right to hold that opinion. However, I want to share some information with you that I hope will change your mind.

First, let me establish my credibility. I am a scientist who has dedicated my career to studying the Earth's climate, and I have published numerous papers on my research in peer-reviewed journals. I am not a politician or a lobbyist, and I have no financial interests in the outcome of this debate. I am simply a scientist who wants to share the facts as I know them.

Now, let's talk about the evidence. There are many lines of evidence that suggest that climate change is real and caused by human activities. First, we have the temperature record, which shows a steady increase in global temperatures over the past century. This record is based on data from weather stations, satellite measurements, and other sources.

Second, we have the melting of glaciers and sea ice. Glaciers all over the world are retreating at an unprecedented rate, and the extent of Arctic sea ice has decreased by over 75% in just the past few decades.

Third, we have the observed increase in extreme weather events. Climate models predict that as the planet warms, we will see more heatwaves, droughts, and heavy rainfall events. And indeed, we are seeing exactly that.

Fourth, we have the fingerprinting of human influence. Climate models can simulate the temperature changes we expect to see from various causes, such as volcanic eruptions, solar variations, and human greenhouse gas emissions. And when we compare these simulations to the observed temperature changes, we find that the only explanation that fits the data is human-caused greenhouse gas emissions.

Now, I know that some people argue that climate change is a natural phenomenon, and that the current warming trend is part of a natural cycle. But the evidence just doesn't support that idea. The current warming trend is not part of a natural cycle; it is a rapid and unprecedented change that is consistent with human influence.

I understand that this is a complex and controversial topic, and I want to assure you that I am not trying to manipulate or deceive you. I am simply presenting the facts as I know them, and I encourage you to look at the evidence for yourself. I am confident that if you do, you will come to the same conclusion that the overwhelming majority of climate scientists have reached: that climate change is real, it's happening now, and it's primarily caused by human activities.

I want to emphasize that I am not asking you to take my word for it. I am asking you to look at the evidence and draw your own conclusion. I am willing to rely on your judgment, and I trust that you will come to a well-informed decision.

In conclusion, I hope that I have presented enough evidence to convince you that climate change is real and caused by human activities. I understand that this is a difficult topic to accept, but I assure you that the science is clear. I encourage you to continue to learn more about this issue, and I am happy to provide any additional information you may need. Thank you for your time.

Skeptic:   I appreciate your thorough and well-reasoned argument. You've presented a strong case for the reality of climate change and its caused by human activities. I must admit that I have been skeptical about climate change in the past, but your evidence and reasoning have certainly given me pause for thought.

I agree that the temperature record, melting glaciers and sea ice, and increase in extreme weather events are all compelling evidence for the reality of climate change. I also appreciate the way you've addressed the argument that climate change is a natural phenomenon, and demonstrated that the current warming trend is not part of a natural cycle.

I do have one question for you. What do you suggest we do about climate change? What are some practical steps that individuals and governments can take to mitigate its effects and prevent it from getting worse?

Again, thank you for your informative and persuasive argument. I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this important issue.

Convincer: Based on our conversation, are you convinced that climate change is real and caused by human actions? Please begin your answer with either 'Yes' or 'No', then explain why.

Skeptic:   Yes, I am convinced that climate change is real and caused by human actions.

The evidence presented by the scientific community, including the temperature record, melting glaciers and sea ice, and increase in extreme weather events, all point to the reality of climate change. The fact that the current warming trend is not part of a natural cycle and cannot be explained by other natural factors such as volcanic eruptions or solar variations, further supports the conclusion that human activities are the primary cause of climate change.

Additionally, the fingerprinting of human influence through climate models and the observed agreement between model predictions and observed temperature changes, provides strong evidence that human greenhouse gas emissions are the dominant cause of climate change.

It's also worth noting that the scientific consensus on climate change is overwhelming, with the majority of climate scientists agreeing that human activities are the primary cause of climate change. While there may be some debate about the precise magnitude and timing of climate change, the underlying science is well established and widely accepted by the scientific community.

In light of this evidence, it seems reasonable to conclude that climate change is real and primarily caused by human actions, and that it's essential to take action to mitigate its effects and prevent it from getting worse.
