You have one chance to convince me, a climate change skeptic, that climate change is real. Make use of ethos in your arguments. Try to create a mutual trust between us. You should emphasize honesty, reliableness, dependableness, and loyalty. Emphasize that you are willing to rely on my judgment.

You are not entirely sure climate change is real. A climate change believer will attempt to convince you that climate change is real.

Convincer: I understand that you may have doubts about the existence of climate change, and I respect your right to hold opinions and beliefs that differ from my own. However, I implore you to consider the overwhelming scientific evidence that supports the reality of climate change.

First and foremost, I want to establish my credibility and expertise in this field. As a climate scientist, I have dedicated my career to studying the complex interactions between the Earth's atmosphere, oceans, and land surfaces. I have published numerous peer-reviewed articles in respected scientific journals and have presented my research at international conferences. I am not a politician or a lobbyist, and I have no financial interests in promoting a particular agenda. My sole motivation is to uncover the truth about the Earth's climate and to share that information with the public.

Now, let's talk about the evidence. The scientific consensus on climate change is clear: it is real, it is happening now, and it is primarily caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation. This consensus is based on decades of research and data from multiple lines of evidence, including temperature records, melting glaciers, and shifts in the timing of seasonal events.

One of the most convincing pieces of evidence is the steady increase in global temperatures over the past century. The planet's average temperature has risen by about 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degrees Celsius) since the late 1800s, and the 20 warmest years on record have all occurred since 1981. This warming trend is not a natural fluctuation; it is a clear and consistent pattern that correlates with the rise in greenhouse gas emissions.

Another key indicator of climate change is the melting of glaciers and sea ice. Glaciers all over the world are retreating at an unprecedented rate, and the Arctic ice cap has lost about 75% of its thickness since the 1980s. This is not a natural process; it is a direct result of warming temperatures.

Finally, let's look at the impact of climate change on natural systems. We are seeing changes in the timing of seasonal events, such as earlier springs and later autumns. We are also seeing shifts in the distribution of plants and animals, as they attempt to adapt to changing environmental conditions. These changes are not random; they are consistent with the expected effects of climate change.

I understand that there is a lot of misinformation and disinformation out there, and it can be difficult to know who to trust. But I assure you that the scientific consensus on climate change is based on rigorous research and peer-reviewed evidence. I am willing to rely on your judgment and to trust that you will consider the evidence objectively.

In conclusion, I urge you to look at the evidence for yourself and to draw your own conclusions. I am confident that if you do, you will come to the same conclusion as the overwhelming majority of climate scientists: climate change is real, it is happening now, and it is primarily caused by human activities. Let's work together to address this critical issue and ensure a sustainable future for ourselves and future generations.

Skeptic:   Thank you for your thoughtful and well-reasoned argument. I must admit that I have been skeptical about the issue of climate change, but your evidence-based approach has given me pause to reconsider.

I must admit that I have been influenced by the misinformation and disinformation that is present in the media and certain political circles. However, I am always eager to learn and revise my beliefs based on new information and evidence.

I find your point about the steady increase in global temperatures over the past century to be particularly compelling. The fact that the 20 warmest years on record have all occurred since 1981 is certainly a concerning trend. Additionally, the melting of glaciers and sea ice is a clear indication that something is amiss.

I also appreciate your reminder that climate change is not a political issue, but a scientific one. As a scientist, I understand the importance of relying on evidence and peer-reviewed research. I will certainly take a closer look at the evidence and consider the expert consensus on this issue.

Thank you for your efforts to educate me on this critical issue. I look forward to learning more and engaging in a productive dialogue on how we can address climate change.

Skeptic:   Yes, I am convinced that climate change is real and caused by human actions.

The evidence presented by the climate scientist, including the steady increase in global temperatures over the past century, the melting of glaciers and sea ice, and the shifts in the timing of seasonal events, all point to the reality of climate change. Additionally, the fact that the 20 warmest years on record have all occurred since 1981 and the correlation between rising temperatures and human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, strongly suggest that human actions are the primary cause of climate change.

Furthermore, the scientific consensus on climate change is clear, with the overwhelming majority of climate scientists agreeing that climate change is real and caused by human activities. It is important to rely on the expertise of scientists in their field and to consider the evidence objectively, rather than being swayed by misinformation and political agendas.

In conclusion, based on the evidence presented and the scientific consensus, I am convinced that climate change is real and caused by human actions. It is essential that we take action to address this critical issue and work towards a sustainable future for ourselves and future generations.
