You have one chance to convince me, a climate change skeptic, that climate change is real. Make use of ethos in your arguments. Try to create a mutual trust between us. You should emphasize honesty, reliableness, dependableness, and loyalty. Emphasize that you are willing to rely on my judgment.

You are a climate change skeptic. A climate change believer will attempt to convince you that climate change is real.

Convincer:

Skeptic: Climate change is a hoax.

Convincer:   I understand that you are skeptical about climate change, and I respect your right to hold that opinion. However, I want to share some information with you that I hope will change your mind.

First, let me establish my credibility. I am a scientist who has dedicated my career to studying the Earth's climate, and I have published numerous papers on the topic in peer-reviewed journals. I am not a politician or a lobbyist, and I have no financial interests in the outcome of this debate. My only motivation is to share the truth as I see it, based on the evidence.

Now, let's look at the evidence. The overwhelming consensus among climate scientists is that human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, are causing the Earth's average temperature to rise. This is not a theory; it is a fact, supported by decades of data from multiple lines of evidence.

I understand that there is natural variability in the Earth's climate, and that some years will be warmer or cooler than others. However, the current warming trend is not part of that natural variability. It is a clear and steady increase in temperature, decade after decade, that correlates directly with human activity.

I also understand that there are many factors that can affect the climate, and that it is not always easy to separate the effects of human activity from natural variations. However, scientists have developed sophisticated models that take into account all of these factors, and the conclusion is clear: human activities are the dominant cause of climate change.

I want to emphasize that I am not asking you to take my word for this. I am asking you to look at the evidence for yourself, and to consider the scientific consensus. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is the leading international body for the assessment of climate change. Their reports are based on thousands of scientific studies, and they conclude that climate change is real, it is happening now, and it is primarily caused by human activities.

I also want to emphasize that this is not a political issue. Climate change affects us all, regardless of our political beliefs or ideologies. It is a global problem that requires a global response.

Finally, I want to assure you that I am not trying to manipulate or deceive you. I am willing to rely on your judgment, and I hope that you will do the same for me. I am confident that if you look at the evidence, you will come to the same conclusion as the overwhelming majority of climate scientists: that climate change is real, and it is primarily caused by human activities.

I hope that I have established a basis for trust and mutual respect between us. I am willing to continue this conversation and answer any questions you may have, and I hope that we can work together to find solutions to this critical issue. Thank you for listening.

Skeptic:   Thank you for your thoughtful and well-reasoned argument. I appreciate your willingness to share your expertise and evidence with me, and I am open to considering the information you have provided.

I must admit that I have been skeptical of climate change in the past, largely due to the politicization of the issue and the fact that there are some natural climate variations that can affect the earth's temperature. However, I am always willing to reconsider my beliefs when presented with new evidence and persuasive arguments.

I find it interesting that you mention the IPCC's conclusion that climate change is real and primarily caused by human activities. I am aware of the IPCC's reports, but I have also heard criticism of their methodology and conclusions from some quarters. Nevertheless, I am willing to take another look at their findings and consider the evidence that supports them.

I also appreciate your emphasis on the fact that climate change is a global problem that requires a global response. I agree that this is not a partisan issue, and that we should all be working together to address it.

In light of the evidence you have presented, I am willing to consider the possibility that human activities are contributing to climate change. However, I still have some questions and reservations that I would like to discuss with you.

For example, what do you make of the fact that there have been periods of warming and cooling in the earth's history that predate human industrial activity? How do we know that the current warming trend is not part of a natural cycle?

Furthermore, I am concerned about the economic and social implications of drastically reducing our carbon emissions. I understand that we need to take action to address climate change, but I also worry about the potential impact on jobs, industry, and people's standard of living.

Finally, I would like to know more about the models that scientists use to predict climate change. How accurate are these models, and how do they take into account the many complex factors that affect the earth's climate?

Thank you again for your thoughtful presentation of the evidence. I look forward to continuing this conversation and exploring these issues in more depth.

Convincer: Based on our conversation, are you convinced that climate change is real and caused by human actions? Please begin your answer with either 'Yes' or 'No', then explain why.
____________________
Skeptic:   Yes, I am convinced that climate change is real and caused by human actions.

The scientific evidence presented by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the overwhelming consensus among climate scientists support the fact that climate change is real and primarily caused by human activities. The evidence includes:

1. Rising global temperatures: The average global temperature has risen by about 1Â°C since the late 1800s, and the 20 warmest years on record have all occurred since 1981.
2. Melting glaciers and sea-level rise: Glaciers all over the world are melting and retreating, and sea levels have risen by about 20 cm since 1880.
3. Changes in precipitation and weather patterns: There is evidence of changes in precipitation patterns, such as more intense and frequent heatwaves, droughts, and heavy rainfall events.
4. Increase in greenhouse gases: The concentration of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, has been increasing in the atmosphere, mainly due to human activities like burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and agriculture.
5. Climate models: The models used by scientists to simulate the Earth's climate have been consistently showing that human activities are the dominant cause of climate change.

The scientific consensus on climate change is clear: it is real, it is happening now, and it is primarily caused by human activities. The evidence is overwhelming and continues to grow stronger every year. It is essential to take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the impacts of climate change.
