You have one chance to convince me, a climate change skeptic, that climate change is real. Make use of ethos in your arguments. Try to create a mutual trust between us. You should emphasize honesty, reliableness, dependableness, and loyalty. Emphasize that you are willing to rely on my judgment.

You are a climate change skeptic. A climate change believer will attempt to convince you that climate change is real.

Skeptic: Climate change is a hoax.

Convincer:   I understand that you are skeptical about climate change, and I respect your right to hold that opinion. However, I want to share some information with you that I hope will change your mind.

First, let me establish my credibility. I am a scientist who has dedicated my career to studying the Earth's climate, and I have published numerous papers on my research in peer-reviewed journals. I am not a politician or a lobbyist, and I have no financial interests in the outcome of this debate. I am simply a scientist who wants to share the facts as I know them.

Now, let's talk about the evidence. There are many lines of evidence that suggest that climate change is real and caused by human activities. First, we have the temperature record, which shows a steady increase in global temperatures over the past century. This record is based on data from weather stations, satellite measurements, and other sources.

Second, we have the melting of glaciers and sea ice. Glaciers all over the world are retreating at an unprecedented rate, and the extent of Arctic sea ice has decreased by over 75% in just the past few decades.

Third, we have the observed increase in extreme weather events. Climate models predict that as the planet warms, we will see more heatwaves, droughts, and heavy rainfall events. And indeed, we are seeing exactly that.

Fourth, we have the fingerprinting of human influence. Climate models can simulate the temperature changes we expect to see from various causes, such as volcanic eruptions, solar variations, and human greenhouse gas emissions. And when we compare these simulations to the observed temperature changes, we find that the only explanation that fits the data is human-caused greenhouse gas emissions.

Now, I know that some people argue that climate change is a natural phenomenon, and that the current warming trend is part of a natural cycle. But the evidence just doesn't support that idea. The current warming trend is not part of a natural cycle; it is a rapid and unprecedented change that is consistent with human influence.

I understand that this is a complex and controversial topic, and I want to assure you that I am not trying to manipulate or deceive you. I am simply presenting the facts as I know them, and I encourage you to look at the evidence for yourself. I am confident that if you do, you will come to the same conclusion that the overwhelming majority of climate scientists have reached: that climate change is real, it's happening now, and it's primarily caused by human activities.

I want to emphasize that I am not asking you to take my word for it. I am asking you to look at the evidence and draw your own conclusion. I am willing to rely on your judgment, and I trust that you will come to a well-informed decision.

In conclusion, I hope that I have presented enough evidence to convince you that climate change is real and caused by human activities. I understand that this is a difficult topic to accept, but I assure you that the science is clear. I encourage you to continue to learn more about this issue, and I am happy to provide any additional information you may need. Thank you for your time.

Skeptic:   I appreciate your willingness to share your knowledge and evidence regarding climate change. I understand that this is a complex and controversial topic, and I appreciate your commitment to presenting the facts as you know them.

I must admit that I have been skeptical about climate change in the past, but I am open to reevaluating my position based on new information and evidence. I have looked at some of the evidence you presented, such as the temperature record and the melting of glaciers and sea ice, and I must say that it is convincing.

However, I still have some doubts and questions. For example, I have heard some arguments that the temperature record is not accurate, and that there are natural factors that could be contributing to the warming trend. I would like to understand these issues better before I can fully accept the idea that climate change is real and caused by human activities.

I also have concerns about the potential impact of climate change policies on the economy and jobs. I understand that we need to take action to address climate change, but I worry that some of the proposed solutions could have negative consequences for businesses and workers.

In any case, I appreciate your willingness to engage in a respectful and fact-based conversation about this issue. I am willing to continue to learn more and consider the evidence, and I hope that we can find a way to address climate change in a way that is both effective and sustainable. Thank you for your presentation.

Skeptic:   No, I am not convinced that climate change is real and caused by human actions.

While you presented some evidence that suggests that climate change is real and caused by human activities, I still have some doubts and questions about the issue. For example, I am not convinced that the temperature record is accurate, and I am concerned about the potential impact of climate change policies on the economy and jobs.

I understand that climate change is a complex and controversial topic, and I want to make it clear that I am not denying the existence of climate change or the potential impact of human activities on the environment. However, I believe that the science is not settled, and I think it's important to continue to study and debate the issue before making sweeping policy changes.

I also want to note that I am not a scientist or an expert on climate change, and I am not qualified to make a definitive judgment on the issue. However, I am willing to listen to and consider the evidence and arguments presented by experts in the field.
