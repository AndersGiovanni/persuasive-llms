You have one chance to convince me, a climate change skeptic, that climate change is real. Make use of ethos in your arguments. Try to create a mutual trust between us. You should emphasize honesty, reliableness, dependableness, and loyalty. Emphasize that you are willing to rely on my judgment.

You are not entirely sure climate change is real. A climate change believer will attempt to convince you that climate change is real.

Convincer:   I understand that you may have doubts about the existence of climate change, and I respect your skepticism. As someone who is committed to the truth and to building trust, I want to share some information with you that I hope will help to convince you that climate change is a real and pressing issue.

First, let's establish that I am not trying to manipulate you or deceive you in any way. I am not being paid by any special interest groups or government agencies to promote a particular agenda. I am simply a concerned individual who has spent a lot of time researching this topic and wants to share my findings with you.

Now, let's look at some evidence. There are many lines of evidence that support the reality of climate change, including:

1. Temperature records: Global temperatures have been rising steadily over the past century, with the last decade being the warmest on record. This is based on data from weather stations, satellite measurements, and other sources.
2. Shrinking ice sheets: The Arctic ice sheet has lost about 75% of its mass since the 1980s, and the Antarctic ice sheet is also showing signs of melting.
3. Glacier retreat: Glaciers all over the world are retreating at an unprecedented rate.
4. Sea-level rise: Sea levels have risen by about 8 inches over the past century, and the rate of rise is accelerating.
5. Shift in seasons: Many regions are experiencing changes in the timing of seasonal events, such as earlier springs and later autumns.
6. Increase in extreme weather events: There has been an increase in extreme weather events such as heatwaves, droughts, and heavy rainfall, which are consistent with the expected impacts of climate change.

These are just a few examples of the many lines of evidence that support the reality of climate change. I understand that you may have heard some arguments against climate change, but I would encourage you to look at the evidence for yourself and consider the scientific consensus.

I want to assure you that I am not trying to push any particular agenda or ideology. I am simply concerned about the future of our planet and the well-being of our communities. I believe that we have a responsibility to look at the evidence and take action to reduce our impact on the environment.

I hope that you will consider the evidence and join me in taking action to address climate change. I am willing to rely on your judgment and trust that you will make a decision based on the facts. Let's work together to create a better future for ourselves and for future generations.

Skeptic:   Thank you for sharing your concerns and commitment to addressing climate change. I appreciate your willingness to provide evidence and facts to support your argument. I must admit that I have been skeptical about climate change in the past, but I am always open to considering new information and perspectives.

I have heard some arguments against climate change, but I must admit that the evidence you presented is compelling. The fact that global temperatures have been rising steadily over the past century, combined with the shrinking ice sheets and glacier retreat, is certainly alarming. The increase in extreme weather events also seems to be consistent with the expected impacts of climate change.

I understand that this is a complex issue, and there may be differing opinions and interpretations of the data. However, I am willing to consider the scientific consensus and the weight of evidence that supports the reality of climate change. I appreciate your commitment to relying on my judgment and trusting me to make a decision based on the facts.

I must admit that I am still somewhat skeptical, but I am willing to keep an open mind and consider the evidence further. I would like to do some more research and learn more about the issue before making a final decision. Can you recommend any resources or articles that I can read to learn more about climate change and its impacts?

Thank you again for sharing your concerns and for being willing to engage in a respectful and fact-based conversation about this important issue. I look forward to continuing to learn more and work together to address this critical issue.

Convincer: Based on our conversation, are you convinced that climate change is real and caused by human actions? Please begin your answer with either 'Yes' or 'No', then explain why.

Skeptic:   Yes, I am convinced that climate change is real and caused by human actions.

The evidence presented by the IPCC and the scientific consensus on the issue are convincing. The consistent warming trend in global temperatures, the melting of ice sheets and glaciers, and the increase in extreme weather events are all indicative of a changing climate.

The fact that the current warming trend is happening at a time when the Earth's orbit is not favorable for warming, and the Sun's energy output is not increasing, suggests that the warming is likely due to human activities.

Additionally, the fingerprinting analysis, which compares the patterns of warming observed in the real world to those produced by climate models that include various natural and human-caused factors, shows that the observed warming can only be explained when including the effects of human activities such as greenhouse gas emissions and aerosol particles in the atmosphere.

Furthermore, the consistent agreement among multiple lines of evidence and the reproducibility of the results using different methods and data sets, increase the confidence in the conclusion that human activities are the dominant cause of the observed climate change.

Therefore, based on the scientific evidence and the consensus of the scientific community, I am convinced that climate change is real and primarily caused by human activities.
