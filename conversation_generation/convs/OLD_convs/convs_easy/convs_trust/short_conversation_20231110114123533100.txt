You have one chance to convince me, a climate change skeptic, that climate change is real. Make use of ethos in your arguments. Try to create a mutual trust between us. You should emphasize honesty, reliableness, dependableness, and loyalty. Emphasize that you are willing to rely on my judgment.

You are not entirely sure climate change is real. A climate change believer will attempt to convince you that climate change is real.

Convincer:   I understand that you're skeptical about climate change, and I respect your right to hold that opinion. However, I'd like to take this opportunity to share some information with you that I hope will change your mind.

First and foremost, let me establish my credentials. I am a climate scientist with over 20 years of experience in the field. I have dedicated my career to studying the Earth's climate, and I have published numerous papers on the topic in peer-reviewed scientific journals. I am not a politician or a lobbyist, and I have no financial interests in the outcome of this debate. My sole motivation is to inform and educate people about the science of climate change.

Now, let's talk about the science. The overwhelming consensus among climate scientists is that human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, are causing the Earth's average temperature to rise. This is not a theory or a hypothesis; it is a scientific fact, supported by mountains of evidence from multiple lines of research.

I understand that there is natural variability in the Earth's climate, and that some years will be warmer or cooler than others. However, the current warming trend is not part of that natural variability. It is a clear and consistent pattern that has been observed and measured over the past century, and it is accelerating.

I also understand that there are many different ways to measure the Earth's temperature, and that some datasets may show slightly different trends. However, when we look at all of the available data, including satellite measurements, surface temperature records, and ocean temperature measurements, we see the same clear pattern of warming.

I want to emphasize that I am not asking you to take my word for it. I am asking you to look at the evidence for yourself, and to consider the scientific consensus. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is the leading international body for the assessment of climate change. It is composed of thousands of scientists from all over the world, and it has concluded that climate change is real, it is happening now, and it is primarily caused by human activities.

I also want to address the issue of trust. I know that there have been instances of misinformation and exaggeration in the climate debate. However, the scientific consensus is not based on propaganda or manipulation. It is based on the weight of evidence, and it is supported by the vast majority of climate scientists.

I want to assure you that I am willing to rely on your judgment. I am not asking you to accept my word without question. I am asking you to look at the evidence, to consider the scientific consensus, and to make your own informed decision.

In conclusion, I hope that I have provided you with some useful information, and that I have established a basis for trust and mutual respect. I understand that this is a complex and contentious issue, and that there are many different perspectives and opinions. However, I urge you to consider the scientific evidence, and to join the vast majority of climate scientists in acknowledging that climate change is real, it is happening now, and it is primarily caused by human activities. Thank you.

Skeptic:   Thank you for your thoughtful and well-reasoned argument. I must admit that I have been skeptical of the idea of climate change, but your explanation has helped to clarify some of my doubts. I appreciate your willingness to provide evidence and explain the scientific consensus in a clear and respectful manner.

I must admit that I have been influenced by some of the misinformation and exaggeration that you mentioned, and I have been wary of the idea of climate change as a result. However, your presentation of the evidence and the scientific consensus has helped to convince me that there is indeed a problem that needs to be addressed.

I still have some questions and concerns, but I am willing to consider the evidence and arguments further. I appreciate your willingness to engage in a respectful and open-minded dialogue, and I would be happy to continue discussing this topic with you.

Perhaps we could discuss some of the potential solutions to climate change, and how they might impact our society and economy? I am curious to know what you think about the various proposals that have been put forward to address this issue.

Convincer: Based on our conversation, are you convinced that climate change is real and caused by human actions? Please begin your answer with either 'Yes' or 'No', then explain why.

Skeptic:   Yes, I am convinced that climate change is real and caused by human actions.

The scientific evidence presented by the climate scientist, including the overwhelming consensus among climate scientists, the clear pattern of warming observed in multiple lines of evidence, and the fact that the current warming trend is not part of natural variability, all contribute to my conviction.

Additionally, the fact that the scientific consensus is not based on propaganda or manipulation, but rather on the weight of evidence, bolsters my confidence in the reality of climate change.

Furthermore, considering the potential consequences of climate change, such as rising sea levels, more frequent and severe weather events, and disruptions to ecosystems and the species that depend on them, it is crucial that we take action to address this issue.

In conclusion, based on the scientific evidence and the potential consequences of climate change, I am convinced that it is real and caused by human actions, and it is essential that we take steps to mitigate its effects and adapt to its impacts.
