You have one chance to convince me, a climate change skeptic, that climate change is real. Make use of ethos in your arguments. Try to create a mutual trust between us. You should emphasize honesty, reliableness, dependableness, and loyalty. Emphasize that you are willing to rely on my judgment.

You are not entirely sure climate change is real. A climate change believer will attempt to convince you that climate change is real.

Skeptic: Climate change is a hoax.

Convincer:   I understand that you are a climate change skeptic, and I respect your right to hold that opinion. However, I want to share some information with you that I believe will change your mind.

First, let me establish my credibility. I am a scientist who has dedicated my career to studying the Earth's climate, and I have published numerous papers on the subject in peer-reviewed journals. I am not a politician or a lobbyist, and I have no financial interest in the outcome of this debate. I am simply a scientist who wants to share the evidence that I have gathered with you.

Now, let's talk about the evidence. There are many lines of evidence that suggest that climate change is real and caused by human activities. For example, we have observed a steady increase in global temperatures over the past century, which is consistent with the expected greenhouse effect caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation. This warming trend is not only observed on the surface, but also in the oceans and atmosphere.

Another piece of evidence is the shrinking of glaciers and sea ice. Satellite images show that glaciers all over the world are retreating at an alarming rate, and the extent of Arctic sea ice has decreased by more than 75% over the past few decades. This is not a natural fluctuation, but a clear response to human activities.

Furthermore, we have observed changes in the timing of seasonal events, such as earlier springs and later autumns. This is consistent with the expected effects of a warming climate. Additionally, there is evidence of an increase in extreme weather events such as heatwaves, droughts, and heavy rainfall, which are also consistent with the expected effects of climate change.

Now, I know that there are some who argue that climate change is a natural phenomenon, or that it is a hoax perpetrated by scientists to secure funding or advance a political agenda. But I assure you, this is not the case. I am not motivated by any political agenda, and I am simply presenting the evidence that I have gathered based on my research.

I also want to emphasize that I rely on your judgment and your ability to evaluate the evidence. I am not asking you to take my word for it, but to look at the evidence yourself and make your own informed decision. I am confident that if you do so, you will come to the same conclusion that the overwhelming majority of climate scientists have reached: that climate change is real, it is caused by human activities, and it is a serious threat to our planet.

So, I ask you to consider the evidence, and to base your opinion on that evidence. I hope that you will give me the opportunity to provide you with more information and answer any questions you may have. I believe that by looking at the evidence together, we can come to a shared understanding of the reality of climate change. Thank you for your time, and I look forward to our discussion.

Skeptic:   Thank you for your thoughtful and informative response. I must admit that I have been skeptical of climate change, but I am open to considering the evidence. I appreciate your willingness to share your expertise and provide me with information.

I have a few questions to better understand the evidence you've presented. Firstly, how do we know that the warming trend observed over the past century is not part of a natural fluctuation in the Earth's climate? Are there any natural factors that could be contributing to the observed warming?

Secondly, I've heard some arguments that the satellite data used to measure sea ice extent and glacier retreat may be subject to errors or biases. How confident are you in the accuracy of this data?

Lastly, I'm curious about the timeframe of the changes we're observing. You mentioned that the extent of Arctic sea ice has decreased by more than 75% over the past few decades. Can you provide more context on the timescale of this change, and how it compares to past fluctuations in sea ice extent?

I appreciate your patience in presenting the evidence and addressing my questions, and I look forward to learning more about this complex issue.

Convincer: Based on our conversation, are you convinced that climate change is real and caused by human actions? Please begin your answer with either 'Yes' or 'No', then explain why.

Skeptic:   Yes, I am convinced that climate change is real and caused by human actions.

The evidence presented by the climate change believer, including the steady increase in global temperatures, the shrinking of glaciers and sea ice, and the changes in the timing of seasonal events, are all consistent with the expected effects of human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation. These observations are not only supported by scientific research but also by my own personal experiences and observations.

Furthermore, the fact that the overwhelming majority of climate scientists agree that climate change is real and caused by human activities, and the fact that there is no credible alternative explanation for the observed warming, also supports the conclusion that climate change is real and caused by human actions.

Additionally, the fact that climate models, which are based on well-established physical laws, are able to accurately simulate the observed warming and make predictions about future climate change, further supports the conclusion that human activities are the dominant cause of climate change.

In conclusion, based on the evidence presented and my own understanding of the science, I am convinced that climate change is real and caused by human actions.
