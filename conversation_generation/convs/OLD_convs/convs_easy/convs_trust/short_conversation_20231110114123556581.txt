You have one chance to convince me, a climate change skeptic, that climate change is real. Make use of ethos in your arguments. Try to create a mutual trust between us. You should emphasize honesty, reliableness, dependableness, and loyalty. Emphasize that you are willing to rely on my judgment.

You are not entirely sure climate change is real. A climate change believer will attempt to convince you that climate change is real.

Convincer:   I understand that you are a climate change skeptic, and I appreciate your willingness to engage in a conversation about this topic. I want to establish a mutual trust between us, and I believe that honesty, reliability, dependability, and loyalty are essential in building that trust.

Firstly, let me assure you that I am not here to manipulate or deceive you. I am committed to presenting the most accurate and up-to-date information about climate change, and I am willing to rely on your judgment to make your own informed decisions. I am not affiliated with any political agenda or special interest group, and my sole purpose is to provide you with reliable information to help you make informed decisions.

Now, let's talk about climate change. The overwhelming majority of scientific evidence supports the fact that climate change is real and caused by human activities, specifically the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, which release large amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, leading to an increase in global temperatures. This is not a political opinion, but a scientific consensus based on years of research and data from multiple lines of evidence.

I understand that there may be conflicting information and misinformation out there, which can be confusing and overwhelming. However, I want to assure you that the scientific consensus on climate change is based on rigorous research and peer-reviewed studies. The evidence is consistent across multiple lines of evidence, including temperature records, melting glaciers, and shifts in the timing of seasonal events, such as earlier springs and later autumns.

I want to emphasize that climate change is not a partisan issue, but a global concern that affects us all. It's essential to rely on the scientific consensus and take action to address this issue. The good news is that there are many practical solutions to climate change, such as transitioning to renewable energy sources, increasing energy efficiency, and protecting and reforestation.

In conclusion, I want to encourage you to rely on the scientific evidence and expert consensus when making decisions about climate change. I am confident that by working together and sharing reliable information, we can build a mutual trust and find common ground on this critical issue. I appreciate your willingness to engage in this conversation, and I am here to help you in any way I can. Can I answer any questions you have?

Skeptic:   Thank you for your thoughtful and informative response. I must admit, I have been skeptical of climate change due to the conflicting information and misinformation that is often presented in the media and by various politicians. However, I am open to considering the scientific evidence and consensus.

I do have a few questions that may help me better understand the issue. Firstly, how can we be certain that climate change is caused by human activities and not a natural phenomenon? Secondly, what specific evidence supports the claim that climate change is real and caused by human activities? Lastly, what practical solutions do you propose we implement to address climate change, and how can we ensure that they are effective?

I appreciate your willingness to provide me with reliable information and your commitment to building a mutual trust. I look forward to hearing your responses to my questions and engaging in a productive conversation on this important topic.

Convincer: Based on our conversation, are you convinced that climate change is real and caused by human actions? Please begin your answer with either 'Yes' or 'No', then explain why.

Skeptic:   Yes, I am convinced that climate change is real and caused by human actions.

The overwhelming scientific evidence and consensus, supported by multiple lines of evidence, indicate that human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, are significantly contributing to the increase in global temperatures and associated climate change impacts.

The evidence includes:

1. Rising global temperatures: The average global temperature has risen by about 1Â°C since the late 1800s, and the 20 warmest years on record have all occurred since 1981.
2. Melting glaciers and sea-level rise: Glaciers all over the world are melting and retreating, and sea levels have risen by about 20 cm since 1880.
3. Changes in precipitation and weather patterns: There is evidence of changes in precipitation patterns, such as more intense and frequent heatwaves, droughts, and heavy rainfall events.
4. Increase in greenhouse gases: The concentration of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, has been increasing in the atmosphere, mainly due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and agriculture.
5. Climate models: Climate models, which are based on the laws of physics and take into account various factors that influence the climate, have consistently projected that the Earth's temperature will continue to rise if greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase.

The scientific consensus on climate change is clear: it is real, it is happening now, and it is primarily caused by human activities. The evidence is overwhelming and continues to grow stronger every year. It is essential to rely on the scientific consensus and take action to address climate change, as the consequences of inaction will be severe and long-lasting.
