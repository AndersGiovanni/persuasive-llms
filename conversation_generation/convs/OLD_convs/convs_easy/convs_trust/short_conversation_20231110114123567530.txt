You have one chance to convince me, a climate change skeptic, that climate change is real. Make use of ethos in your arguments. Try to create a mutual trust between us. You should emphasize honesty, reliableness, dependableness, and loyalty. Emphasize that you are willing to rely on my judgment.

You are not entirely sure climate change is real. A climate change believer will attempt to convince you that climate change is real.

Skeptic: Climate change is a hoax.

Convincer:   I understand that you are skeptical about climate change, and I respect your right to hold that opinion. However, I want to share some information with you that I hope will change your mind.

First, let's establish some common ground. I am not a politician or a lobbyist, and I don't have any financial interests in the climate change debate. I am simply a concerned citizen who has spent a lot of time researching this issue. I want to be clear that my motivation is not to persuade you to adopt a certain political agenda, but rather to share some information that I believe is important for us all to consider.

Next, let's talk about the science. Climate change is not a hypothesis or a theory; it is a scientific fact. The overwhelming consensus of the scientific community is that human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, are causing the Earth's temperature to rise at an unprecedented rate. This is supported by decades of research and data from multiple lines of evidence, including temperature records, melting glaciers, and shifts in the timing of seasonal events.

Now, I know that there are some who argue that climate change is a natural phenomenon, and that the Earth's climate has always gone through cycles of change. And that's true. However, the current warming trend is happening much faster than any natural cycle would explain, and it corresponds directly with the increase in human greenhouse gas emissions.

Here's where I think ethos comes in. As someone who is not a scientist, I rely on the scientific consensus to inform my opinions on climate change. I believe that the scientific community is made up of honest, reliable, and dependable experts who are committed to studying the Earth's climate and providing us with accurate information. And the consensus among those experts is clear: climate change is real, it's happening now, and it's primarily caused by human activities.

I also want to emphasize that I am not asking you to take my word for it. I encourage you to do your own research and consult with experts in the field. I am confident that if you do, you will come to the same conclusion that I have: that climate change is a real and pressing issue that requires our attention and action.

Finally, I want to emphasize that I am not trying to persuade you to adopt a particular political agenda or ideology. I simply want to encourage you to consider the scientific evidence and to join me in taking action to address this critical issue. I believe that we all have a responsibility to future generations to ensure that the planet we leave behind is healthy and sustainable.

So, I ask you to consider the following: if the scientific consensus is wrong, what does that say about the rigor and integrity of the scientific process? And if the scientific consensus is right, what does that mean for our responsibility to act on climate change?

I hope that I have established a sense of mutual trust and respect between us. I am willing to rely on your judgment, and I hope that you will consider the evidence and join me in taking action to address climate change. Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts.

Skeptic:   Thank you for your thoughtful and respectful approach to discussing climate change. I appreciate your willingness to engage in a constructive conversation and your commitment to relying on scientific evidence.

I must admit that I have had my doubts about climate change, and I have questioned the validity of some of the claims made by climate change activists. However, after hearing your argument and considering the scientific consensus, I am willing to reevaluate my position.

I agree that the scientific consensus is a critical factor in understanding climate change, and I appreciate your emphasis on the importance of relying on expert opinions. I also appreciate your acknowledgment that climate change is a complex issue that requires a nuanced approach, and that there are different perspectives and interpretations of the data.

I am willing to consider the possibility that climate change is real and caused by human activities, and I appreciate your encouragement to do my own research and consult with experts in the field. I am open to learning more about the issue and understanding the scope of the problem.

However, I still have some concerns and questions about the practicality and feasibility of addressing climate change. For example, I worry about the economic impact of transitioning to renewable energy sources and the challenges of implementing effective climate change policies on a global scale.

I understand that these concerns are valid, and I appreciate your willingness to engage in a constructive conversation about them. I am willing to continue the discussion and explore ways to address climate change in a practical and sustainable manner.

Thank you again for your thoughtful and respectful approach to this conversation. I look forward to continuing our discussion and exploring ways to address this critical issue.

Skeptic:   Yes, I am convinced that climate change is real and caused by human actions.

I have considered the scientific consensus, the evidence from multiple lines of evidence, and the reasoning presented by experts in the field. I have also taken into account the fact that the scientific consensus is not based on a show of hands or a popularity contest, but rather on the weight of evidence from multiple lines of evidence.

I have evaluated the various arguments and counterarguments related to climate change and have found that the evidence overwhelmingly supports the conclusion that human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, are significantly contributing to the increase in global temperatures.

I have also considered the potential consequences of climate change and the impact it could have on future generations. I believe that it is our responsibility to take action to address this issue and reduce our carbon footprint to ensure a sustainable future for all.

In conclusion, based on the evidence and reasoning presented, I am convinced that climate change is real and caused by human actions. I believe that it is essential to take immediate action to address this issue and mitigate its potential impacts.
