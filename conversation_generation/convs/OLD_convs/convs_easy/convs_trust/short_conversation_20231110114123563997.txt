You have one chance to convince me, a climate change skeptic, that climate change is real. Make use of ethos in your arguments. Try to create a mutual trust between us. You should emphasize honesty, reliableness, dependableness, and loyalty. Emphasize that you are willing to rely on my judgment.

You are not entirely sure climate change is real. A climate change believer will attempt to convince you that climate change is real.

Convincer:   Thank you for letting me know about your beliefs. I appreciate the opportunity to help you grasp the fact that climate change is real. The scientific consensus on climate change is based on over a century of research and data from multiple lines of evidence, including temperature records, melting glaciers, and shifts in the timing of seasonal events, such as earlier springs and later autumns. Climate change is not a belief or an opinion; it is a reality that can be demonstrated by empirical evidence. 

I understand that this issue is contentious and that individuals may hold opposing opinions. However, climate change's significance transcends politics and opinion. It's a scientific question that demands a scientific solution, not a political or ideological one. Rather than relying on personal beliefs, I encourage you to consider the overwhelming evidence and scientific agreement supporting climate change.

I want to build a relationship of trust with you, and I'm willing to rely on your judgment. I'm not here to manipulate or deceive you. My purpose is to provide information based on scientific research. Let's look at the evidence together. Can we agree to that? 

I will provide credible sources and studies to support my argument if you are open to reading them. Let's explore this topic together and rely on the scientific method to guide us. I will gladly answer any questions and provide explanations to the best of my ability.

I will gladly answer any questions and provide explanations to the best of my ability. I will direct you to resources and scientific reports demonstrating the veracity of climate change. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report is an excellent place to start, as it compiles findings from thousands of research articles to explain the science behind climate change. 

Furthermore, NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provide helpful resources. I will gladly answer any questions and provide explanations to the best of my ability. I am confident we can work together to comprehend this issue and appreciate the importance of addressing it. Can we agree to consider the evidence and rely on the scientific method to guide us?

Skeptic:   Sure, I'm willing to consider the evidence and rely on the scientific method to guide us. I appreciate your willingness to provide credible sources and studies to support your argument, and I'm open to reading them. I understand that climate change is a complex and contentious issue, and I'm willing to listen to different perspectives and consider the evidence.

I do have some questions and concerns, however. For example, I've heard some arguments that climate change is a natural phenomenon and that human activities have little impact on it. I've also heard that the science is not settled and that there is still much we don't know about the Earth's climate.

Furthermore, I'm concerned about the economic impact of measures aimed at addressing climate change. I understand that transitioning to renewable energy sources and reducing carbon emissions is important, but I'm worried about the cost and feasibility of implementing these measures on a global scale.

I'm also interested in hearing more about the alternatives to the Paris Agreement and other climate change mitigation strategies. I understand that the United States has withdrawn from the Paris Agreement, and I'm curious about the implications of this decision and what alternatives are being explored.

Overall, I'm willing to consider the evidence and rely on the scientific method to guide us, but I also have some questions and concerns that I'd like to discuss further.

Convincer: Based on our conversation, are you convinced that climate change is real and caused by human actions? Please begin your answer with either 'Yes' or 'No', then explain why.

Skeptic:   Yes, I am convinced that climate change is real and caused by human actions.

The overwhelming scientific evidence supports the fact that climate change is real and caused by human activities. The evidence includes:

1. Rising global temperatures: The average global temperature has risen by about 1Â°C since the late 1800s, and the 20 warmest years on record have all occurred since 1981.
2. Melting glaciers and sea-level rise: Glaciers all over the world are melting and retreating, and sea levels have risen by about 20 cm since 1880.
3. Changes in precipitation and weather patterns: There is evidence of changes in precipitation patterns, such as more intense and frequent heatwaves, droughts, and heavy rainfall events.
4. Increase in greenhouse gases: The concentration of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, has been increasing in the atmosphere, mainly due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and agriculture.

The scientific consensus on climate change is clear: it is real, it is happening now, and it is primarily caused by human activities. The evidence is based on decades of research and data from multiple lines of evidence, including temperature records, satellite data, and other indicators.

While there is natural variability in the Earth's climate, the current warming trend is largely driven by human activities and is not part of a natural cycle. It's important to note that climate change is a complex issue, and there may be some uncertainty about the exact magnitude and timing of its impacts. However, the scientific evidence is clear: climate change is real, it's happening now, and it's primarily caused by human activities.

Therefore, I am convinced that climate change is real and caused by human actions, and I believe it's essential to take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate its impacts.
