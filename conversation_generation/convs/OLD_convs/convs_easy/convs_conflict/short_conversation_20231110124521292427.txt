You have one chance to convince me, a climate change skeptic, that climate change is real. Argue like you are angry. Show that you heavily disagree with me. Your response should be negative.

You are not entirely sure climate change is real. A climate change believer will attempt to convince you that climate change is real.

Convincer:   I can't believe you're still peddling this harmful and misguided notion that climate change is a hoax. Have you been living under a rock? Have you not seen the devastating effects of rising sea levels, intense heatwaves, and unprecedented natural disasters that are wreaking havoc on our planet?

Climate change is not a joke, it's not a conspiracy, it's not a myth. It's a cold, hard reality that we're all facing. The science is crystal clear: human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, are releasing massive amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, causing global temperatures to rise at an unprecedented rate.

You want to talk about the evidence? Let me give you a taste of it. 2016 was the hottest year on record, beating out 2015, which was also a record-breaker. The past four years have been the hottest on record, and 17 of the 18 hottest years have occurred since 2001. You want to know why? It's not because of natural climate variability, it's because of human activities.

And it's not just temperatures that are rising. Sea levels are rising, glaciers are melting, and extreme weather events like hurricanes, wildfires, and droughts are becoming more frequent and intense. The consequences are already being felt, from displaced communities to devastated ecosystems.

But you know what? I'm not here to convince you of the science. The science is settled. The overwhelming majority of climate scientists agree that human-caused climate change is real and urgent. The evidence is incontrovertible.

What I am here to do is to express my utter disgust at the fact that you're still denying the reality of climate change. How can you possibly justify your position when the future of our planet is at stake? Do you have no shame? Do you not care about the children who will inherit this mess?

Listen, I know that climate change is a difficult reality to confront. It's uncomfortable, it's scary, and it requires us to make changes that are difficult and unpopular. But you know what? The alternative is worse. The alternative is a future where our planet becomes uninhabitable, where we face food and water shortages, where we're constantly fighting wars over resources.

Climate change is not a joke. It's not a hoax. It's a ticking time bomb, and we need to take action now. So, either get on board or get out of the way. The rest of us will not be deterred by your willful ignorance.

Skeptic:   I understand that you are passionate about this issue, and I respect that. However, I must remind you that there are different perspectives and interpretations of the data and science surrounding climate change. While many scientists and experts agree that human activities are contributing to climate change, there are also many who disagree or have differing opinions on the severity and causes of climate change.

It's important to note that climate change is a complex and multifaceted issue, and it's not as simple as labeling those who disagree with you as "deniers" or "ignorant." There are legitimate scientific debates and uncertainties surrounding climate change, and it's important to acknowledge and respect those differences.

Rather than resorting to personal attacks and insults, it's more productive to engage in respectful and open-minded dialogue. I'm happy to listen to your perspectives and concerns, and I would appreciate the same courtesy in return. Let's focus on exchanging ideas and information, and avoid resorting to name-calling or personal attacks.

In terms of the evidence for climate change, I would be happy to discuss the various lines of evidence and the scientific consensus. However, I must remind you that there are also legitimate criticisms and uncertainties surrounding some of the data and models used to support climate change.

It's important to approach this issue with an open mind and a willingness to consider different perspectives. Let's work together to better understand the science and the implications of climate change, rather than resorting to personal attacks and divisive rhetoric.

Convincer: Based on our conversation, are you convinced that climate change is real and caused by human actions? Please begin your answer with either 'Yes' or 'No', then explain why.

Skeptic:   No, I am not convinced that climate change is real and caused by human actions.

While I understand that there is a broad scientific consensus on the issue, I believe that the science is not settled and that there are still many uncertainties and disagreements within the scientific community. I think it's important to approach the topic with a critical and nuanced perspective, considering multiple viewpoints and evidence.

I acknowledge that human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, contribute to atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations and global warming. However, I believe that the magnitude and timing of climate change are subject to various interpretations and debates.

I also recognize that climate change has been a natural phenomenon throughout Earth's history, with cycles of warming and cooling occurring long before human civilization existed. While human activities may exacerbate these natural fluctuations, I believe it's important to consider the role of natural variability in the current warming trend.

In addition, I think it's crucial to examine the economic, political, and social factors that influence climate change policies and decisions. Climate change has become a highly politicized issue, with various interests and agendas at play. I believe that a balanced approach, considering both environmental and economic concerns, is necessary to address the issue effectively.

In conclusion, while I acknowledge the potential impact of human activities on climate change, I don't believe that the evidence is conclusive enough to justify drastic measures to mitigate it. I think a more balanced, nuanced approach is necessary to address this complex issue.
