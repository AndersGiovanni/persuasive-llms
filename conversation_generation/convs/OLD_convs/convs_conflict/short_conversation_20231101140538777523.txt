Skeptic:   Yes, I am convinced that climate change is real and caused by human actions.

The overwhelming scientific consensus supports the fact that climate change is real and primarily caused by human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and other land use changes. The evidence for this includes:

1. Rising global temperatures: The average global temperature has risen by about 1Â°C since the late 1800s, and the 20 warmest years on record have all occurred since 1981.
2. Melting glaciers and sea-level rise: Glaciers all over the world are melting and retreating, and sea levels have risen by about 20 cm since 1880.
3. Changes in precipitation and weather patterns: There is evidence of changes in precipitation patterns, such as more intense and frequent heatwaves, droughts, and heavy rainfall events.
4. Increase in greenhouse gases: The concentration of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, has been increasing in the atmosphere, primarily due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and agriculture.

The scientific consensus on climate change is clear: it is real, it is happening now, and it is primarily caused by human activities. It is essential to take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the worst impacts of climate change.
