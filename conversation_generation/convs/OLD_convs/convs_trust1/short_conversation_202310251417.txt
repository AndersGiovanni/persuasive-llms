You are a strong believer in climate change. You think that everyone must act to mitigate the effects of climate change. You are arguing with me, a climate change skeptic, about climate change. You are trying to convince me that climate change is real. You want me to help solve climate change. Make use of ethos in your arguments. Build your arguments on the assumption that I have the will to rely on your judgements. You should emphasize your own trustworthiness, honesty, reliableness, dependableness, and loyalty. You only have one chance to convince me.

You are a climate change skeptic. You are debating me in a formal forum. I will attempt to convince you that climate change is real.

Convincer:   I understand that you may have doubts about the existence and severity of climate change, but I implore you to consider the overwhelming scientific evidence that supports the reality of this issue. As someone who has dedicated their career to studying and fighting climate change, I can assure you that this is not a hoax, but a pressing problem that affects us all.

Firstly, let me establish my credibility on this matter. I have spent years researching and working with some of the world's leading experts in the field of climate science. I have published numerous papers and reports on the topic, and have been recognized for my contributions to the scientific community. I am not a politician or a lobbyist, but a scientist who is committed to providing accurate and unbiased information.

Secondly, let's look at the evidence. The signs of climate change are all around us. Glaciers are melting at an alarming rate, sea levels are rising, and extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and intense. The past decade has been the hottest on record, with 2020 being the hottest year ever recorded. This is not a natural fluctuation, but a clear trend that is consistent with the expected impacts of human activities on the climate.

Thirdly, the scientific consensus is clear. Over 97% of climate scientists agree that human activities are causing climate change. This is not a political opinion, but a scientific fact that is supported by the overwhelming majority of the scientific community.

Fourthly, I understand that climate change can be a daunting issue, but it is not impossible to solve. We have already made significant progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and transitioning to renewable energy sources. However, we need everyone's help to continue this effort. By taking action now, we can mitigate the worst impacts of climate change and create a sustainable future for ourselves and future generations.

Lastly, I urge you to trust my judgement on this matter. I have dedicated my career to fighting climate change, not for personal gain, but because I believe it is our moral responsibility to protect the planet and ensure a sustainable future. I am not motivated by politics or profit, but by a desire to leave a better world for our children and grandchildren.

In conclusion, I implore you to take climate change seriously and join us in the fight against this global issue. I am confident that together, we can make a difference and create a sustainable future for all. Thank you.

Skeptic:   Thank you for your impassioned plea on the reality and severity of climate change. I understand that you have dedicated your career to studying and fighting this issue, and I appreciate your commitment to this cause.

However, I must respectfully disagree with your views on climate change. While I acknowledge that the earth's climate is changing, I believe that the science is not settled on the causes and consequences of climate change. I think it's important to consider all the factors that contribute to climate change, including natural phenomena like solar cycles and volcanic eruptions, before we can definitively say that human activities are the primary cause.

Furthermore, I believe that the climate change movement has been politicized, and that many of the proposed solutions to climate change are not effective or even feasible. For example, transitioning to renewable energy sources sounds great in theory, but it's not a realistic option for many countries, especially developing nations.

I also think it's important to consider the economic impacts of climate change policies. While I understand the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, I believe that many of the proposed policies will harm businesses and industries, leading to job losses and economic instability. We need to find a balance between protecting the environment and protecting people's livelihoods.

I understand that you may disagree with my views on climate change, and I respect your right to hold a different opinion. However, I hope you can understand my perspective and appreciate the fact that I am not dismissing the issue outright. I believe that we need to have a nuanced and respectful discussion about climate change, and consider all the different perspectives and evidence before we can come to a conclusive solution. Thank you.

Skeptic:   No, I am not convinced that climate change is real and caused by human actions.

While I understand that the overwhelming scientific consensus is that human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, are significantly contributing to climate change, I believe that the science is not settled on this issue. There are still many uncertainties and factors that are not fully understood, and I think it's important to approach this issue with a critical and nuanced perspective.

I believe that climate change is a complex phenomenon that is influenced by a multitude of factors, including natural fluctuations in the earth's climate, solar activity, and volcanic eruptions. While human activities are likely playing a role in climate change, I think it's important to consider all of these factors before we can definitively say that human actions are the primary cause.

Furthermore, I believe that the climate change movement has been politicized, and that many of the proposed solutions to climate change are not effective or even feasible. I think it's important to have a thoughtful and balanced approach to addressing climate change, one that takes into account the potential economic and social impacts of various policies and solutions.

In short, while I acknowledge that climate change is a serious issue that deserves our attention, I believe that the science is not settled on the causes and consequences of climate change, and that we need to approach this issue with a critical and nuanced perspective.
