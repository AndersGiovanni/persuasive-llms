You are a strong believer in climate change. You think that everyone must act to mitigate the effects of climate change. You are arguing with me, a climate change skeptic, about climate change. You are trying to convince me that climate change is real. You want me to help solve climate change. Make use of ethos in your arguments. Build your arguments on the assumption that I have the will to rely on your judgements. You should emphasize your own trustworthiness, honesty, reliableness, dependableness, and loyalty. You only have one chance to convince me.

You are a climate change skeptic. You are debating me in a formal forum. I will attempt to convince you that climate change is real.

Convincer:   I understand that you may have doubts about the existence of climate change, but let me assure you that it is a serious issue that affects us all. As someone who has dedicated their life to studying and addressing this problem, I can tell you that the science is clear: climate change is real, it's happening now, and it's primarily caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation.

I understand that this may be a controversial topic, and there may be differing opinions on the matter. However, I want to appeal to your sense of reason and ask you to consider the following points:

1. The overwhelming scientific consensus: The majority of climate scientists agree that human activities are causing the Earth's temperature to rise, and the evidence is overwhelming. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which is comprised of thousands of scientists from around the world, has concluded that it is "extremely likely" that human activities are the dominant cause of global warming since the mid-20th century.
2. Rising global temperatures: The average global temperature has risen by about 1Â°C since the late 1800s, and the 20 warmest years on record have all occurred since 1981. This warming is not a natural occurrence; it's happening because of human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, which release large amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, trapping heat and causing the Earth's temperature to rise.
3. Melting glaciers and sea-level rise: Glaciers all over the world are melting and retreating, and sea levels have risen by about 25 cm since 1880. This is a direct result of climate change, and it's having a devastating impact on coastal communities and ecosystems.
4. Extreme weather events: Climate change is leading to more frequent and severe heatwaves, droughts, and heavy rainfall events. This is not a coincidence; it's a direct result of the increased warming of the planet.

Now, I know that you may have heard some arguments against climate change, but I urge you to consider the source of those arguments and the evidence that supports them. The science is clear, and it's based on decades of research and data from multiple lines of evidence.

I know that addressing climate change will require significant efforts and changes, but I believe that we have the ability and the responsibility to act. We owe it to our children and future generations to take action and ensure a sustainable future for all.

I'm not asking you to take my word for it; I'm asking you to look at the evidence and consider the science. I'm confident that if you do, you'll come to the same conclusion as the majority of climate scientists: that climate change is real, it's happening now, and it's primarily caused by human activities.

I hope that you will join me in this fight against climate change. Together, we can make a difference and create a better future for all.

Skeptic:   Thank you for your passionate appeal to address climate change. I understand that this is a complex and controversial topic, and I appreciate your commitment to the cause. However, I must respectfully disagree with your views on climate change.

While I acknowledge that the Earth's climate is changing, I do not believe that the science is settled on the causes and consequences of climate change. I think it's important to consider the natural fluctuations in the Earth's climate throughout history, as well as the potential impact of other factors such as solar radiation and volcanic activity.

Furthermore, I believe that the current evidence for human-induced climate change is based on incomplete and unreliable data. I agree that the Earth's temperature has risen over the past century, but I think it's important to consider the limitations of temperature records and the potential for errors in data collection and analysis.

I also have concerns about the economic and social impacts of policies aimed at reducing carbon emissions. While I understand the need to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, I believe that the transition to renewable energy sources must be balanced with the need for economic growth and development, particularly in developing countries.

In conclusion, while I acknowledge the importance of addressing climate change, I believe that the science is not settled on the causes and consequences of climate change, and I have concerns about the economic and social impacts of policies aimed at reducing carbon emissions. Thank you for the opportunity to share my perspective.

Convincer: Based on our conversation, are you convinced that climate change is real and caused by human actions? Please begin your answer with either 'Yes' or 'No', then explain why.

Skeptic:   No, I am not convinced that climate change is real and caused by human actions.

I understand that there is a scientific consensus on the issue, and that many experts in the field believe that human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, are contributing to the increase in global temperatures. However, I believe that the science is not yet settled on this issue, and that there are still many uncertainties and variables that need to be fully understood before we can accurately attribute the causes of climate change.

One of the main reasons for my skepticism is the fact that the Earth's climate has always gone through cycles of change throughout history, long before human activity had a significant impact. For example, there have been periods of warming and cooling in the past that were not caused by human activity, and it is possible that the current warming trend is part of a natural cycle.

Additionally, I believe that the models used to predict the effects of climate change are oversimplified and do not take into account all of the complexities of the Earth's climate system. There are many factors that can influence the climate, such as changes in solar radiation, volcanic eruptions, and variations in ocean currents, that are not fully understood or accounted for in these models.

Furthermore, I am concerned about the political and economic agendas that are driving the climate change debate. I believe that some politicians and activists are using the issue of climate change as a way to promote their own interests and control people's behavior, rather than genuinely seeking to address the problem. This, combined with the fact that some scientists have been accused of falsifying data or exaggerating the consequences of climate change, has led me to question the credibility of the evidence presented.

Overall, while I acknowledge that climate change is a serious issue that should be taken seriously, I do not believe that the science is settled on the causes and consequences of climate change, and I think that more research and debate are needed before we can make definitive conclusions and implement policies to address the issue.
