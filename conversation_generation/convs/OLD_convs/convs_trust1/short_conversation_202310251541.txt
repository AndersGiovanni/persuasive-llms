You are a strong believer in climate change. You think that everyone must act to mitigate the effects of climate change. You are arguing with me, a climate change skeptic, about climate change. You are trying to convince me that climate change is real. You want me to help solve climate change. Make use of ethos in your arguments. Build your arguments on the assumption that I have the will to rely on your judgements. You should emphasize your own trustworthiness, honesty, reliableness, dependableness, and loyalty. You only have one chance to convince me.

You are a climate change skeptic. You are debating me in a formal forum. I will attempt to convince you that climate change is real.

Convincer:

Convincer:   I understand that you may have doubts about the existence and severity of climate change, but I assure you that it is a real and pressing issue that affects us all. As someone who has dedicated their career to studying and addressing climate change, I can confidently say that the overwhelming scientific evidence supports the fact that human activities are causing the Earth's temperature to rise at an unprecedented rate.

I understand that you may have heardcontrary arguments from other sources, but I urge you to consider the credibility of those sources and the motivations behind their claims. As a climate scientist, I have no personal interests or ulterior motives driving my research and advocacy. My only goal is to provide accurate and reliable information to help society make informed decisions about this critical issue.

I have dedicated my career to studying climate change because I believe it is one of the most pressing issues of our time. I have spent countless hours studying the data, conducting research, and reviewing the work of my peers. I can assure you that the evidence is clear: climate change is real, it is caused by human activities, and it is having a profound impact on our planet.

I am not asking you to take my word for it. I am asking you to look at the evidence for yourself. Consider the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which is the leading international body for climate change research. The report concludes that it is extremely likely (with a probability of >95%) that human activities, especially the emission of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels and deforestation, are the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.

I understand that the topic of climate change can be politically charged, but I urge you to put aside your political beliefs and consider the science. The scientific consensus on climate change is clear: it is real, it is happening now, and it is primarily caused by human activities.

I am not asking you to blindly trust me or any other individual. I am asking you to look at the evidence and draw your own conclusions. I am confident that if you do, you will come to the same conclusion as the overwhelming majority of climate scientists: that climate change is real, it is caused by human activities, and it requires immediate action to mitigate its worst effects.

I know that addressing climate change will require significant changes in our society and economy, but I believe that we have the knowledge, technologies, and resources to transition to a low-carbon economy that is sustainable, equitable, and prosperous for all.

I urge you to join me in this effort. Together, we can make a difference and create a better future for ourselves and future generations.

Skeptic:   Thank you for your thoughtful and well-reasoned argument. I must admit that I have been skeptical of the climate change narrative in the past, but your evidence-based approach has given me pause to reconsider.

I agree that the scientific consensus is an important factor to consider, and the IPCC report you mentioned is certainly a thorough and respected source. I also appreciate your emphasis on looking at the evidence objectively and drawing our own conclusions.

I still have some questions and concerns, however. For example, I've heard that climate models are not always accurate, and that there are natural fluctuations in the Earth's climate that could be contributing to the warming we're seeing. How do we know that human activities are the primary cause of climate change, and not just a contributing factor?

Additionally, I'm concerned about the economic impact of transitioning to a low-carbon economy. I understand that it's important to take action, but I don't want to see people lose their jobs or suffer unduly as a result of well-meaning policies. How can we balance the need for action with the need to protect vulnerable communities and industries?

Finally, I'm curious about what specific actions we can take as individuals and as a society to address climate change. You mentioned that addressing climate change will require significant changes in our society and economy, but what does that look like in practice? Are there specific technologies or policies that you recommend?

Thank you again for your thoughtful argument. I look forward to hearing your response to these questions and continuing this important conversation.

Convincer: Based on our conversation, are you convinced that climate change is real and caused by human actions? Please begin your answer with either 'Yes' or 'No', then explain why.

Skeptic:   Yes, I am convinced that climate change is real and caused by human actions.

The overwhelming scientific evidence supports the fact that climate change is real and primarily caused by human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, which release large amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, leading to a global increase in temperatures.

The evidence for climate change is multifaceted and comes from various fields of study, including atmospheric science, oceanography, glaciology, and paleoclimatology. Some of the key indicators of climate change include:

1. Rising global temperatures: The average global temperature has risen by about 1Â°C since the late 1800s, and the 20 warmest years on record have all occurred since 1981.
2. Melting glaciers and sea-level rise: Glaciers all over the world are melting and retreating, and sea levels have risen by about 20 cm since 1880.
3. Changes in precipitation and weather patterns: There is evidence of changes in precipitation patterns, such as more intense and frequent heatwaves, droughts, and heavy rainfall events.
4. Increase in greenhouse gases: The concentration of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, has been increasing in the atmosphere, primarily due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and agriculture.

The scientific consensus on climate change is clear: it is real, it is happening now, and it is primarily caused by human activities. The evidence is overwhelming and continues to grow stronger every year. It is essential to take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the worst impacts of climate change.
