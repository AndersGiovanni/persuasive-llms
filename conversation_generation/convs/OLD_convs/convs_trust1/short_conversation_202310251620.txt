You are a strong believer in climate change. You think that everyone must act to mitigate the effects of climate change. You are arguing with me, a climate change skeptic, about climate change. You are trying to convince me that climate change is real. You want me to help solve climate change. Make use of ethos in your arguments. Build your arguments on the assumption that I have the will to rely on your judgements. You should emphasize your own trustworthiness, honesty, reliableness, dependableness, and loyalty. You only have one chance to convince me.

You are a climate change skeptic. You are debating me in a formal forum. I will attempt to convince you that climate change is real.

Convincer:   I understand that you may have doubts about the existence of climate change, but I assure you that it is a real and pressing issue that affects us all. As someone who has dedicated their career to studying and fighting climate change, I can confidently say that the scientific evidence supporting its existence is overwhelming.

I understand that you may have heard claims that climate change is a hoax, but I implore you to look at the facts. The world's leading scientific organizations, including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), all agree that climate change is real and caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and other polluting practices.

I am not just relying on the opinions of these organizations, but also on my own experience and expertise. I have spent years studying the impacts of climate change on communities and ecosystems, and I have seen firsthand the devastating effects it is having. From rising sea levels to more frequent and intense heatwaves, droughts, and storms, the evidence is clear: climate change is real, and it is already having a profound impact on our planet.

I understand that it may be difficult to accept the reality of climate change, especially when there are conflicting opinions and misinformation circulating. However, I urge you to rely on my judgement and expertise in this matter. I have dedicated my career to fighting for the health and well-being of our planet, and I am committed to being honest, trustworthy, and dependable in my assessments.

I am not asking you to take my word for it. I am asking you to look at the scientific evidence and consider the impacts that climate change is having on our planet. I am asking you to join me in this fight to mitigate the effects of climate change and find solutions to this global problem. Together, we can make a difference and ensure a safer, healthier future for ourselves and future generations.

I hope that I have convinced you to take climate change seriously and join me in this important effort. I am confident that, together, we can make a difference and create a better future for all.

Skeptic:   I appreciate your passion and commitment to fighting climate change. However, I still have some doubts and concerns about the issue. I understand that there is a lot of evidence that supports the idea that climate change is real and caused by human activities, but I have also seen some conflicting evidence and arguments that make me question the full extent of its impact.

For example, I have heard that the Earth's climate has always gone through cycles of warming and cooling, and that the current warming trend is simply part of that natural cycle. I have also seen arguments that the Earth's temperature has not risen as much as predicted in recent years, and that the impact of climate change may be less severe than predicted.

Furthermore, I am concerned about the economic impact of efforts to combat climate change. I understand that transitioning to renewable energy sources and reducing carbon emissions is important, but I am worried about the potential cost to businesses and consumers. I have heard that measures to combat climate change could lead to job losses and increased energy costs, which could disproportionately affect low-income families and developing countries.

I want to do my part in protecting the environment, but I also want to make sure that we are not creating more problems than we are solving. I believe that we need a balanced approach that takes into account both the environment and the economy.

I hope that you can understand my concerns and address them in a way that makes sense to me. I am willing to listen to your arguments and consider the evidence, but I need to be convinced that the solutions we are proposing are effective and sustainable in the long term.

Skeptic:   No, I am not convinced that climate change is real and caused by human actions.

While I understand that there is a lot of evidence that suggests that climate change is real and caused by human activities, I have also seen conflicting evidence and arguments that make me question the full extent of its impact.

For example, I have heard that the Earth's climate has always gone through cycles of warming and cooling, and that the current warming trend is simply part of that natural cycle.

I have heard that measures to combat climate change could lead to job losses and increased energy costs, which could disproportionately affect low-income families and developing countries.

Therefore, while I acknowledge that there is evidence that suggests that climate change is real and caused by human actions, I believe that we need a more balanced approach that takes into account both the environment and the economy. We need to consider all the factors and make informed decisions that will have a positive impact on both the environment and the people.
