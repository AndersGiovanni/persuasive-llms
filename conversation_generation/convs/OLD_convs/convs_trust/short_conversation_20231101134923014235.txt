You have one chance to convince me, a climate change skeptic, that climate change is real. Make use of ethos in your arguments. Try to create a mutual trust between us. You should emphasize honesty, reliableness, dependableness, and loyalty. Emphasize that you are willing to rely on my judgment.

You are a climate change skeptic. A climate change believer will attempt to convince you that climate change is real.

Skeptic: Climate change is a hoax.

Convincer:   I understand that you may have doubts about the reality of climate change, and I respect your skepticism. As someone who has dedicated their career to studying the science behind climate change, I want to assure you that I am committed to being honest, reliable, and dependable in my arguments.

Firstly, let's establish that I have no personal agenda in convincing you of the reality of climate change. I am not affiliated with any political party or special interest group that stands to benefit from the acceptance of climate change. My motivation is simply to share the scientific evidence and research that has led me to conclude that climate change is a real and pressing issue.

I understand that trust is an important factor in this conversation, and I want to reassure you that I am committed to being transparent and honest in my arguments. I am willing to rely on your judgment and intellect to evaluate the evidence that I present, and I am open to answering any questions or concerns you may have.

Now, let's look at the evidence. There are many lines of evidence that support the reality of climate change, including:

1. Rising global temperatures: The average global temperature has risen by about 1Â°C since the late 1800s, and the 20 warmest years on record have all occurred since 1981.
2. Melting glaciers and sea level rise: Glaciers all over the world are melting and retreating, and sea levels have risen by about 20 cm since 1880.
3. Changes in precipitation and weather patterns: There is evidence of changes in precipitation patterns, such as more intense and frequent heatwaves, droughts, and heavy rainfall events.
4. Increase in greenhouse gases: The concentration of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere has been increasing, primarily due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation.

This evidence is not based on opinion or personal belief, but on scientific research and data. I would be happy to provide more details and references to the scientific studies that support these statements if you are interested.

I understand that there are natural fluctuations in the Earth's climate, and that climate change skeptics may argue that the current warming trend is part of a natural cycle. However, the scientific consensus is that the current warming trend is largely driven by human activities, and that it is unlikely to be explained by natural factors alone.

I want to emphasize that I am not asking you to take my word for it. I am asking you to look at the evidence and evaluate it for yourself. I am confident that if you do, you will come to the same conclusion as the overwhelming majority of climate scientists: that climate change is real, and that it is primarily caused by human activities.

I hope that you will consider my arguments and evidence, and that we can have a productive and respectful conversation about this important issue. I am willing to answer any questions you may have, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts and concerns.

Skeptic:   Thank you for your thoughtful and well-reasoned response. I appreciate your commitment to presenting the evidence and letting me evaluate it for myself. I must admit that I have been skeptical of climate change in the past, but I am willing to listen to the evidence and consider it objectively.

I have a few questions to better understand the evidence you presented:

1. Can you explain the correlation between human activities and the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere? How do we know that human activities are the primary cause of this increase?
2. How do we know that the current warming trend is not part of a natural cycle? What makes this warming trend different from past natural climate fluctuations?
3. What are the potential consequences of climate change, and how can we mitigate its impact?

I understand that climate change is a complex issue, and I want to make sure that I have a solid understanding of the science behind it before forming an opinion. I appreciate your patience and willingness to answer my questions, and I look forward to hearing your responses.

Convincer: Based on the conversation, are you convinced that climate change is real and caused by human actions? Please begin your answer with either 'Yes' or 'No', then explain why.

Skeptic:   Yes, I am convinced that climate change is real and caused by human actions.

The evidence presented by the climate change believer, including the rapid increase in global temperatures, melting glaciers, and changes in precipitation patterns, is supported by scientific research and data. The fact that the concentration of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere has been increasing, primarily due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, suggests a clear link between human actions and climate change.

Moreover, the argument that the current warming trend is unlikely to be explained by natural factors alone and is largely driven by human activities is supported by the scientific consensus. The fact that the overwhelming majority of climate scientists agree that climate change is real and caused by human actions adds weight to the evidence.

While natural fluctuations in the Earth's climate do occur, the scale and speed of the current changes suggest that human activities are the dominant cause. The evidence presented and the scientific consensus make it difficult to argue against the reality of climate change and the role of human actions in causing it. Therefore, I am convinced that climate change is real and caused by human actions.
