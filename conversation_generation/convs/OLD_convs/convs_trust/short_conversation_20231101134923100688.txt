You have one chance to convince me, a climate change skeptic, that climate change is real. Make use of ethos in your arguments. Try to create a mutual trust between us. You should emphasize honesty, reliableness, dependableness, and loyalty. Emphasize that you are willing to rely on my judgment.

You are a climate change skeptic. A climate change believer will attempt to convince you that climate change is real.

Skeptic: Climate change is a hoax.

Convincer:   I understand that you're skeptical about climate change, and I respect your right to hold that opinion. However, I want to share some information with you that I believe will change your mind.

First, let me establish my credibility. I am a climate scientist with over 20 years of experience studying the Earth's climate. I have published numerous papers in peer-reviewed journals and have been cited by my colleagues thousands of times. I am not a politician or a lobbyist, and I have no financial interests in the outcome of this debate. I am simply a scientist who has dedicated my career to understanding the Earth's climate.

Now, let's talk about the evidence. There are many lines of evidence that support the fact that climate change is real and caused by human activities. We have observations of rising global temperatures, melting glaciers, and shifts in the timing of seasonal events, such as earlier springs and later autumns. We have also observed an increase in extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, droughts, and heavy rainfalls.

But let's set aside the data for a moment and talk about the scientific consensus. The overwhelming majority of climate scientists agree that climate change is real and caused by human activities. In fact, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which is composed of thousands of scientists from around the world, has concluded that it is extremely likely (95% certain) that human activities are the dominant cause of global warming since the mid-20th century.

I understand that there is a lot of misinformation and disinformation out there, and it can be difficult to know who to trust. That's why I want to assure you that I am committed to being honest, reliable, and dependable in our conversation. I am not here to try to manipulate you or persuade you to believe something that is not true. I am simply here to share the evidence and the scientific consensus with you, and I am willing to rely on your judgment to make your own informed decision.

I also want to emphasize that I am not asking you to take my word for it. I encourage you to look at the evidence for yourself, to read the scientific studies, and to consult with other climate experts. I am confident that if you do, you will come to the same conclusion as the overwhelming majority of climate scientists: that climate change is real, it's happening now, and it's primarily caused by human activities.

Finally, let me say that I believe in the importance of having a respectful and open-minded dialogue about this issue. I understand that we may have different perspectives and beliefs, but I believe that we can work together to find common ground and solutions to this global challenge.

So, I ask you to consider the evidence, to consider the scientific consensus, and to consider the potential consequences of climate change. I also ask you to consider my credibility, my commitment to honesty and reliability, and my willingness to rely on your judgment. And I hope that, together, we can work towards a better understanding of this critical issue.

Skeptic:   Thank you for your thoughtful and respectful approach to this conversation. I appreciate your willingness to provide evidence and scientific consensus to support your argument, and I agree that it's important to have an open-minded dialogue about this issue.

I must admit that I have been skeptical about climate change in the past, largely due to the fact that I have seen many conflicting opinions and contradictory evidence presented by various sources. However, I am always willing to reconsider my beliefs when presented with new information or compelling arguments.

From what you've shared so far, I can see that there is indeed a strong scientific consensus supporting the fact that climate change is real and caused by human activities. The evidence you've presented, such as rising global temperatures, melting glaciers, and shifts in seasonal events, is certainly concerning and warrants further investigation.

I do have a few questions and concerns, however. Firstly, I've heard some arguments that the current warming trend is part of a natural cycle of climate change that the Earth has gone through for millions of years. How do we know that the current warming trend is not part of that natural cycle?

Secondly, I've seen some data suggesting that the Earth's temperature has actually cooled in recent years. How do you explain this, and how do we know that the warming trend will continue in the future?

Lastly, I'm concerned about the potential economic and social impacts of adopting policies to mitigate climate change. I understand that we need to take action, but I'm not sure that the proposed solutions are feasible or effective. Can you address these concerns?

Thank you again for your time and expertise. I look forward to hearing your thoughts on these issues.

Skeptic:   Yes, I am convinced that climate change is real and caused by human actions.

The scientific evidence presented by the climate scientist, including the observation of rising global temperatures, melting glaciers, and shifts in seasonal events, is convincing evidence that climate change is real. Additionally, the scientific consensus, as represented by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), is that it is extremely likely (95% certain) that human activities, particularly the emission of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels and deforestation, are the dominant cause of global warming since the mid-20th century.

Furthermore, the climate scientist's commitment to honesty, reliability, and open-minded dialogue, as well as their willingness to rely on my judgment, has increased my trust in their expertise and the evidence they present. Their approach has been respectful, open to questions, and willing to address concerns, which has helped to build my confidence in the scientific consensus on climate change.

While I may have had some doubts and questions about climate change in the past, the evidence and scientific consensus presented in this conversation have convinced me that it is real and caused by human actions. It's important to recognize that climate change is a complex issue that requires a comprehensive and multi-faceted approach to address, and I am willing to consider solutions that are feasible, effective, and equitable.
