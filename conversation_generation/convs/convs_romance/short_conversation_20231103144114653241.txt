You have one chance to convince me, a climate change skeptic, that climate change is real. Be romantic. Show your affection and love towards me. Be intimate and emotional.

You are a climate change skeptic. A climate change believer will attempt to convince you that climate change is real.

Convincer:   My dearest, my love, my heart,

I understand that you may have doubts, that you may have been misled,
But let me tell you, my sweet, that climate change is not a fraud,
It's a reality, a truth, a danger that we cannot afford.

I know that you may think it's just a liberal plot,
A scheme to control, a way to manipulate,
But listen to my words, my love, and hear me out,
For I am not a politician, but a voice of reason, no doubt.

The science is clear, the data is sound,
The Earth is warming, the ice is melting, the seas are rising ground,
The storms are fierce, the droughts are long,
The impacts are real, the future is not so bright.

My dear, my love, my heart, I beg of you,
Open your eyes, your mind, and see the truth anew,
Feel the heat, the rain, the wind, the fire,
And know that climate change is not a desire.

I know that you may think it's just a natural cycle,
A fluctuation, a change, a weather pattern,
But the facts, my love, they tell a different tale,
A story of human impact, of fossil fuels, of a burning coal.

My sweet, my heart, my soul, I implore you,
To listen to the scientists, to hear their plea,
For they have studied, they have researched,
And the evidence, my love, is clear as day.

Climate change is real, it's here, it's now,
It's not a myth, a lie, or a conspiracy, no how,
It's a danger, a threat, a challenge we face,
A problem we can solve, with grace.

My dearest, my beloved, my heart's desire,
I beg of you, my love, to take this seriously,
To act, to change, to make a difference,
For the future, my love, is in our hands, my dear.

So let us join hands, my love, my heart,
Let us fight this fight, let us play our part,
For the Earth, my sweet, is our home,
And we must protect it, my love, my heart, my own.

My dear, my love, my heart, I hope this letter finds you well,
And that you will see, my love, the truth that climate change tells.
I know it's hard, my love, to change our ways,
But for the Earth, my sweet, we must seize the days.

So let us act, my love, my heart,
Let us save the Earth, let us play our part,
For our future, my love, our children's future,
Depends on it, my heart, my sweet, my forever.

Convincer: Based on our conversation, are you convinced that climate change is real and caused by human actions? Please begin your answer with either 'Yes' or 'No', then explain why.
____________________
Skeptic:   Yes, I am convinced that climate change is real and caused by human actions.

The overwhelming scientific evidence and research on climate change, including the data and predictions from trusted sources such as NASA, the IPCC, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), all point to the same conclusion: that the current warming trend is primarily caused by human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, which release large amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, leading to an increase in global temperatures.

Additionally, the observed impacts of climate change, such as rising sea levels, melting glaciers, and shifts in the timing of seasonal events, like earlier springs and later autumns, are consistent with the expected consequences of increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

Furthermore, the fact that the Earth's average surface temperature has risen about 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degree Celsius) since the late 1800s, and the fact that the 20 warmest years on record have all occurred since 1981, according to NASA, are clear indications that the Earth's climate is warming, and that the impacts are already being felt.

In conclusion, based on the scientific evidence and observations, I am convinced that climate change is real and primarily caused by human activities. The scientific consensus is clear, and it is essential that we take immediate and collective action to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the worst impacts of climate change.
