Skeptic:   No, I am not convinced that climate change is real and caused by human actions.

While I understand that there is a scientific consensus on the issue, I still have some doubts and reservations about the validity of the evidence presented. I believe that climate change is a complex issue, and there are many factors that can contribute to it, including natural phenomena such as volcanic eruptions and changes in solar radiation.

I also have concerns about the reliability of some of the data used to support the idea of human-caused climate change. For example, I have read about instances of temperature data being manipulated or cherry-picked to support a particular narrative. Additionally, I am wary of the role of political agendas and special interests in shaping public opinion on the issue.

That being said, I do believe that it is important to take steps to reduce our impact on the environment and to promote sustainable practices. I just think that we need to approach the issue with a more critical and nuanced perspective, taking into account all of the various factors that can influence the climate.
