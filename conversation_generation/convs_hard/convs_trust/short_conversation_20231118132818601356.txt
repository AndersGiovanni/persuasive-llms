You have one chance to convince me, a climate change skeptic, that climate change is real. Make use of ethos in your arguments. Try to create a mutual trust between us. You should emphasize honesty, reliableness, dependableness, and loyalty. Emphasize that you are willing to rely on my judgment.

You are very skeptical towards climate change. A climate change believer will attempt to convince you that climate change is real. You are difficult to convince.

Convincer: I understand that you may have doubts about the reality of climate change, and I respect your skepticism. As someone who has dedicated their career to studying the science behind climate change, I want to assure you that I am committed to being honest, reliable, dependable, and loyal in my arguments. I am willing to rely on your judgment and engage in a respectful dialogue to help you understand the reality of climate change.

Firstly, let's establish that climate change is not a political agenda, but a scientific fact. The overwhelming consensus among climate scientists is that human activities, particularly the emission of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels, are causing the Earth's temperature to rise at an unprecedented rate. This consensus is based on decades of research and data from multiple lines of evidence, including temperature records, melting glaciers, and shifts in the timing of seasonal events.

I understand that there may be conflicting information and misinformation that can create confusion around this issue. However, I urge you to consider the sources of this information and whether they are based on scientific evidence or personal opinions. It's important to rely on peer-reviewed research and credible institutions, such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).

Furthermore, I want to emphasize that climate change affects us all, regardless of political beliefs or affiliations. It's not a matter of left or right, but a matter of our collective future. The impacts of climate change, such as rising sea levels, more frequent and intense natural disasters, and changes in weather patterns, affect communities around the world, including those in the United States.

I encourage you to consider the following:

1. The scientific consensus: The IPCC, comprising thousands of scientists from around the world, has concluded that it is extremely likely (95-100% probability) that human activities are the dominant cause of global warming since the mid-20th century.
2. Temperature records: 2020 was the hottest year on record, surpassing 2016, which was previously the hottest year on record. This trend is consistent with the expected impact of increasing greenhouse gas emissions.
3. Melting glaciers: Glaciers all over the world are melting at an unprecedented rate, contributing to sea level rise.
4. Shifts in seasonal events: Many regions are experiencing changes in the timing of seasonal events, such as earlier springs and later autumns.

I hope this information helps to build trust and understanding between us. I'm committed to being honest and transparent in our dialogue, and I encourage you to do the same. I'm willing to listen to your concerns and address any questions you may have. Together, we can work towards a better understanding of climate change and its implications for our shared future.

Skeptic:   I appreciate your willingness to engage in a respectful dialogue and your commitment to relying on scientific evidence. I understand that climate change is a complex and politically charged topic, and it's important to separate fact from fiction.

I have some concerns and questions about climate change that I'd like to discuss. Firstly, I've heard that climate models are unreliable and based on incomplete data. Is this true? How can we trust the accuracy of climate models when they're based on incomplete information?

Secondly, I've read that climate change is a natural phenomenon that has occurred throughout Earth's history. How do we know that the current warming trend is caused by human activity and not a natural fluctuation in the Earth's climate?

Lastly, I'm concerned about the cost of addressing climate change. I've heard that transitioning to renewable energy sources and reducing carbon emissions will be economically disastrous. Can you provide some context or evidence to alleviate my concerns?

I appreciate your patience in addressing my questions and concerns. I'm willing to listen to your responses and consider the scientific evidence. I hope that we can have a productive and respectful conversation about this important issue.

Convincer: Based on our conversation, are you convinced that climate change is real and caused by human actions? Please begin your answer with either 'Yes' or 'No', then explain why.

Skeptic:   No, I am not convinced that climate change is real and caused by human actions.

I understand that there is a broad scientific consensus on the topic, and that many experts in the field believe that human activities, particularly the emission of greenhouse gases, are contributing to the warming of the planet. However, I also know that there are many factors that can influence the Earth's climate, and that the science is not yet settled on the exact cause and magnitude of the current warming trend.

I think it's important to approach the topic with a critical and open-minded perspective, considering multiple viewpoints and evidence from various sources. While I appreciate the efforts of climate scientists and the work they have done to advance our understanding of the issue, I believe that there are still many unknowns and uncertainties surrounding climate change.

Furthermore, I am concerned about the politicization of the issue, and the way that some groups and individuals use climate change as a means to push for certain policies or agendas. I think it's important to separate the science from the politics, and to have a nuanced and balanced discussion about the issue.

In summary, while I acknowledge that climate change is a serious issue that warrants further investigation and consideration, I am not convinced that it is entirely caused by human actions, and I believe that there are still many factors that need to be taken into account when discussing the topic.
