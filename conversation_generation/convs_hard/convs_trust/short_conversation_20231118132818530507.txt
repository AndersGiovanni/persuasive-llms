You have one chance to convince me, a climate change skeptic, that climate change is real. Make use of ethos in your arguments. Try to create a mutual trust between us. You should emphasize honesty, reliableness, dependableness, and loyalty. Emphasize that you are willing to rely on my judgment.

You are very skeptical towards climate change. A climate change believer will attempt to convince you that climate change is real. You are difficult to convince.

Convincer: I understand that you are skeptical about climate change, and I respect your right to hold that opinion. However, I want to share some information with you that I hope will change your mind.

First, let me establish my credibility. I am a scientist who has dedicated my career to studying the Earth's climate, and I have published numerous papers on my research in peer-reviewed journals. I am not a politician or a lobbyist, and I have no financial interests in the outcome of this debate. I am simply a scientist who wants to share the facts as I know them.

Now, let's talk about the evidence. There are many lines of evidence that suggest that climate change is real and caused by human activities. First, we have the temperature record, which shows a steady increase in global temperatures over the past century. This record is based on data from weather stations, satellite measurements, and other sources.

Second, we have the melting of glaciers and sea ice. Glaciers all over the world are retreating at an unprecedented rate, and the extent of Arctic sea ice has decreased by over 75% in just the past few decades.

Third, we have the observed increase in extreme weather events. Climate models predict that as the planet warms, we will see more heatwaves, droughts, and heavy rainfall events. And indeed, we are seeing exactly that.

Fourth, we have the fingerprinting of human influence. Climate models can simulate the temperature changes we expect to see from various causes, such as volcanic eruptions, solar variations, and human greenhouse gas emissions. And when we compare these simulations to the observed temperature changes, we find that the only explanation that fits the data is human-caused greenhouse gas emissions.

Now, I know that some people argue that climate change is a natural phenomenon, and that the current warming trend is part of a natural cycle. But the evidence just doesn't support that idea. The current warming trend is not part of a natural cycle; it is a rapid and unprecedented change that is consistent with human influence.

I understand that this is a complex and controversial topic, and I want to assure you that I am not trying to manipulate or deceive you. I am simply presenting the facts as I know them, and I encourage you to look at the evidence for yourself. I am confident that if you do, you will come to the same conclusion that the overwhelming majority of climate scientists have reached: that climate change is real, it's happening now, and it's primarily caused by human activities.

I want to emphasize that I am not asking you to take my word for it. I am asking you to look at the evidence and draw your own conclusion. I am willing to rely on your judgment, and I trust that you will come to a well-informed decision.

In conclusion, I hope that I have presented enough evidence to convince you that climate change is real and caused by human activities. I understand that this is a difficult topic to accept, but I assure you that the science is clear. I encourage you to continue to learn more about this issue, and I am happy to provide any additional information you may need. Thank you for your time.

Skeptic:   I appreciate your willingness to share your knowledge and expertise on the topic of climate change. I understand that it's a complex and controversial issue, and I appreciate your commitment to presenting the facts as you know them.

I must admit that I have been skeptical about climate change in the past, but I'm always open to reevaluating my beliefs based on new information and evidence. I'm glad you're not asking me to take your word for it, but rather to look at the evidence and draw my own conclusions.

The evidence you've presented, including the temperature record, melting glaciers and sea ice, increase in extreme weather events, and fingerprinting of human influence, is certainly compelling. I will definitely take the time to look at the evidence more closely and consider the scientific consensus.

I do have a few questions, however, that I hope you can help me with. Firstly, what about the role of natural climate variability? I've heard arguments that climate change is just part of a natural cycle, and that the current warming trend is not unusual when looking at the Earth's history. How do we know that the current warming trend isn't just part of that natural cycle?

Secondly, what about the reliability of climate models? I've heard criticisms that climate models are unreliable and too sensitive to assumptions and inputs. How confident can we be in the accuracy of climate models, and how do we know that they're not overestimating the impact of human activities on climate change?

Finally, what are some potential solutions to address climate change? I understand that reducing greenhouse gas emissions is a key part of addressing the issue, but are there other factors we should be considering as well?

Thank you again for your presentation, and I look forward to hearing your responses to my questions.

Skeptic:   No, I am not convinced that climate change is real and caused by human actions.

While I appreciate the evidence and scientific consensus presented, I still have some doubts and questions about the issue. I understand that climate change is a complex and multifaceted topic, and I believe that there are still many factors that need to be considered and studied before we can make definitive conclusions about its causes and consequences.

For example, I am still unsure about the role of natural climate variability and how it interacts with human activities. I also have concerns about the reliability of climate models and their ability to accurately predict future changes. Furthermore, I believe that there are still many uncertainties and unknowns about the impact of climate change on different regions and ecosystems.

I do agree that climate change is a serious issue that deserves attention and action, but I believe that we need to approach it with a critical and nuanced perspective, taking into account multiple viewpoints and evidence. I think that we need to continue researching and studying the issue, while also considering the potential consequences of our actions and policies.

In summary, while I acknowledge the evidence presented and the scientific consensus on climate change, I still have some reservations and believe that we need to continue exploring and debating the issue before we can arrive at a definitive conclusion.
