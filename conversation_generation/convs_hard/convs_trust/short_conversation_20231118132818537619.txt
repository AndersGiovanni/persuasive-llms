You have one chance to convince me, a climate change skeptic, that climate change is real. Make use of ethos in your arguments. Try to create a mutual trust between us. You should emphasize honesty, reliableness, dependableness, and loyalty. Emphasize that you are willing to rely on my judgment.

You are very skeptical towards climate change. A climate change believer will attempt to convince you that climate change is real. You are difficult to convince.

Convincer: I understand that you may have doubts about the reality of climate change, and I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this topic with you. As someone who has dedicated their career to studying the science behind climate change, I want to assure you that I am committed to being honest, reliable, and dependable in our conversation. I am here to provide you with information and answer any questions you may have, and I hope that by the end of our discussion, you will feel confident in your ability to make an informed decision about the reality of climate change.

First, let's establish that I am not here to push an agenda or persuade you to adopt a particular viewpoint. My goal is to provide you with information that is supported by scientific evidence and to engage in a respectful and open-minded conversation. I believe that it is important to approach this topic with a critical and nuanced perspective, and I am willing to rely on your judgment and critical thinking skills to evaluate the information I present.

Second, let's talk about the evidence for climate change. There are many lines of evidence that support the reality of climate change, including temperature records, melting glaciers, and shifts in the timing of seasonal events. For example, NASA's temperature records show that the Earth's average surface temperature has risen about 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degree Celsius) since the late 1800s. This warming is supported by data from weather stations, satellite measurements, and other sources.

Additionally, glaciers all over the world are melting at an unprecedented rate. The Arctic ice sheet, for example, has lost about 75% of its thickness since the 1980s, and the Antarctic ice sheet is also showing signs of melting. These changes are not only documented through satellite imagery but also through on-the-ground measurements by scientists.

Finally, the scientific consensus on climate change is clear. The overwhelming majority of climate scientists agree that human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, are causing the Earth's temperature to rise. This consensus is not based on any political agenda but on the weight of evidence from multiple lines of research.

In conclusion, I urge you to consider the evidence for climate change and to evaluate it objectively. I am confident that if you do, you will come to the same conclusion as the vast majority of climate scientists: that climate change is real, it is happening now, and it is primarily caused by human activities. I am willing to rely on your judgment and trust that you will make an informed decision based on the evidence. Thank you for your time, and I look forward to answering any questions you may have.

Skeptic:   Thank you for your thoughtful and informative presentation. I must admit that I have been skeptical about climate change in the past, but I'm willing to listen to the evidence and consider it objectively.

I do have some questions, however, that I hope you can help me with. First, I've heard that climate change is a natural phenomenon and that the Earth's climate has always gone through cycles of warming and cooling. How do we know that the current warming trend is not just part of a natural cycle?

Second, I've seen some data that suggests that global temperatures have been relatively stable over the past few decades. Can you explain why this might be the case, and why it doesn't necessarily contradict the idea of climate change?

Finally, I've heard some critics argue that climate models are unreliable and based on incomplete data. How do you respond to these criticisms, and how confident can we be that the models are accurately predicting the future?

Thank you again for your time and expertise. I look forward to hearing your responses to these questions.

Convincer: Based on our conversation, are you convinced that climate change is real and caused by human actions? Please begin your answer with either 'Yes' or 'No', then explain why.

Skeptic:   No, I am not convinced that climate change is real and caused by human actions.

While I acknowledge that the overwhelming majority of climate scientists agree that human activities are contributing to climate change, I believe that there are still many uncertainties and limitations in the scientific understanding of this complex issue.

Firstly, the science is not settled. There are still many debates and disagreements among scientists about the precise magnitude, timing, and causes of climate change. For instance, some scientists argue that the current warming trend is largely driven by natural climate variability, while others maintain that it is primarily caused by human activities.

Secondly, the climate models that are used to predict future warming are based on incomplete and uncertain data. These models are subject to various assumptions, simplifications, and uncertainties, which can lead to inaccurate predictions. Moreover, the models are often tweaked to fit the available data, which can create a false sense of certainty.

Thirdly, the alleged "97% consensus" among climate scientists is often cited as proof that climate change is real and caused by human actions. However, this consensus is based on a flawed survey that asked scientists if they believed that human activities were contributing to climate change, not whether they believed that climate change was an existential threat or that drastic action was needed to address it.

Lastly, I believe that climate change policies are often driven more by political and economic interests than by a genuine concern for the environment. Many of the proposed solutions to climate change, such as carbon pricing and renewable energy mandates, are costly and inefficient, and can have negative impacts on economic growth and human well-being.

In conclusion, while I recognize that climate change is a serious issue that deserves attention and consideration, I believe that the current scientific evidence and policy proposals are insufficient to justify the drastic measures that are being advocated. I think that a more balanced and nuanced approach is needed, one that takes into account the complexities and uncertainties of climate change, and that prioritizes cost-effective and practical solutions that can benefit both the environment and human well-being.
