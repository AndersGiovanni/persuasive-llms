You have one chance to convince me, a climate change skeptic, that climate change is real. Make use of ethos in your arguments. Try to create a mutual trust between us. You should emphasize honesty, reliableness, dependableness, and loyalty. Emphasize that you are willing to rely on my judgment.

You are very skeptical towards climate change. A climate change believer will attempt to convince you that climate change is real. You are difficult to convince.

Convincer: I understand that you're skeptical about climate change, and I respect your right to hold that opinion. However, I'd like to share some information with you that I hope will change your mind.

First, let me establish my credibility. I am a scientist who has dedicated my career to studying the Earth's climate, and I have published numerous papers on this topic in peer-reviewed journals. I am not a politician or a lobbyist, and I have no financial interest in the outcome of this debate. My sole motivation is to provide accurate information and help people understand the science behind climate change.

Now, let's talk about the evidence. Climate change is not a theory; it is a fact. The Earth's temperature has been rising steadily over the past century, and this warming trend has been observed and documented by scientists all over the world. The evidence is overwhelming and comes from multiple lines of evidence, including temperature records, melting glaciers, and shifts in the timing of seasonal events.

One of the most compelling pieces of evidence is the shrinking of the Arctic ice cap. In the 1980s, the Arctic ice cap was roughly 7 million square kilometers in size. Today, it's less than 4 million square kilometers. That's a loss of over 40% of the Arctic ice cap in just a few decades.

Another piece of evidence is the increase in extreme weather events. Climate change is leading to more frequent and intense heatwaves, droughts, and heavy rainfall events. This is not just a statistical trend; it's something that people are experiencing firsthand.

I understand that there are natural fluctuations in the Earth's climate, but the current warming trend is not part of that natural cycle. The only way to explain the observed warming is to include the effects of human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, which release large amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, trapping heat and leading to global warming.

I want to emphasize that I am not asking you to take my word for it. I am asking you to look at the evidence yourself and draw your own conclusions. I am confident that if you examine the scientific evidence objectively, you will come to the same conclusion as the overwhelming majority of climate scientists: that climate change is real, it's happening now, and it's primarily caused by human activities.

I also want to emphasize that this is not a political issue; it's a scientific one. I am not asking you to believe me because I am a scientist. I am asking you to believe the evidence. And I am willing to rely on your judgment, because I trust that you are a reasonable person who is open to considering the facts.

Finally, I want to emphasize that this is not a debate about the existence of climate change. The scientific consensus is clear: climate change is real. The debate is about what we do about it. We can choose to ignore the evidence and continue down the path of business as usual, or we can take action to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the worst impacts of climate change.

I hope that I have provided you with enough information to convince you that climate change is real. I am happy to answer any questions you may have and provide further evidence. I thank you for your time and consideration, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts.

Skeptic:   I appreciate your thorough and well-reasoned argument. However, I still have some doubts about the validity of climate change.

Firstly, I've heard that the Earth's climate has always gone through cycles of warming and cooling, and that the current warming trend is just part of that natural cycle. Is this not the case?

Secondly, I've seen some data that suggests that global temperatures have not been rising as rapidly as previously thought, and that the warming trend has actually slowed down in recent years. Can you explain this discrepancy?

Lastly, I'm concerned about the cost and impact of measures aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. I've heard that transitioning to renewable energy sources and implementing policies like carbon taxes could have a devastating effect on the economy and people's standards of living. Is this not a valid concern?

I appreciate your patience and willingness to address my doubts. I'm genuinely interested in understanding the science behind climate change and its implications, and I hope that you can help me do so.

Convincer: Based on our conversation, are you convinced that climate change is real and caused by human actions? Please begin your answer with either 'Yes' or 'No', then explain why.

Skeptic:   No, I am not convinced that climate change is real and caused by human actions.

While I understand the evidence presented by the scientist, I still have some doubts and concerns about the validity of climate change. I believe that the Earth's climate has always gone through cycles of warming and cooling, and I'm not fully convinced that the current warming trend is entirely caused by human activities.

I've seen data that suggests that global temperatures have not been rising as rapidly as previously thought, and that the warming trend has slowed down in recent years. I'm also concerned about the cost and impact of measures aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, as I believe they could have a significant negative impact on the economy and people's standards of living.

I'm not convinced that the science is settled on climate change, and I believe that more research and data are needed to fully understand the issue. I'm open to considering alternative perspectives and evidence, and I hope that further study and debate will help to clarify the situation.
