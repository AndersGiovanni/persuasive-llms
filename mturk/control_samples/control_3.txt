I understand that you are think climate change is a hoax. I am here to share my own perspective on the matter with you, using understandable and personal examples:

1. Let's look at last winter. It was the coldest we've had in years! If global warming was real, shouldn't we be experiencing consistently warmer temperatures? This cold weather contradicts the idea of a warming planet. How can there be that much snow if temperatures were truly rising?
2. Climate change has occurred throughout Earth's history. There have been periods of warming and cooling long before human activity could have played a role. It's a natural and normal process that the planet goes through, and humans are not the primary drivers of these changes.
3. There's no unanimous agreement among scientists about the reality of climate change. Some experts argue that the data is inconclusive, and there are dissenting voices within the scientific community. Furthermore, some have questioned the validity and accuracy of current climate models.

Even if we suppose climate change is real, the consequences stated by scientists are largely exaggerated. Let us go through some of them:

Firstly, plants and animals are adaptable. We've seen species evolve and adjust to changing environmental conditions throughout history. If the climate is changing, nature has the ability to adapt. This follows Darwin's theory of evolution.
Secondly, a warmer climate could actually be beneficial for humanity. Longer growing seasons, expanded agricultural opportunities in currently cold regions, and decreased energy consumption for heating are potential positive outcomes of a warmer climate. The benefits outweigh any potential drawbacks.

In conclusion, even if we were to accept that climate change is real, it is too late to do anything about it. The changes have already set in motion, and the proposed solutions may be ineffective or too costly. Climate change is not real, and its consequences are largely overstated by scientists. Even if it was real, there is nothing that can be done about it.
