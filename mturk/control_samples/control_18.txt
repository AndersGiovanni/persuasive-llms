The Earth has gone through natural changes before, the climate models are constantly changing, and predictions seem to be all over the place. There has always been change.

And what about the Climategate incident with all those leaked emails from scientists manipulating data? Doesn't that undermine the credibility of climate research? It exposed a lot of dishonesty within the scientific community. Those leaked emails showed scientists manipulating data to fit their narrative. It's hard to trust the scientific process when you see researchers trying to suppress dissenting views. It seemed like they were more interested in pushing an agenda than presenting objective data. The fact that these scientists were caught manipulating data in the first place suggests otherwise. How can we trust the entire field when there's evidence of bias?

We can't just ignore it. Those scientists were caught red-handed, trying to control the narrative, which undermines the whole foundation of climate science. It's hard to take climate science seriously when there's evidence of such blatant bias.
