     You're joking, right? Climate change is a hoax? That's 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     like saying the earth is flat, or that smoking doesn't 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     cause cancer. It's a ridiculous, ignorant, and dangerous 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     belief that flies in the face of overwhelming scientific 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     evidence. 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     Let me tell you, I am not pleased to have to explain this 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     to you. I can't believe I have to waste my time on 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     someone who denies the reality of climate change. But 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     fine, I'll play along. 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     First of all, let's talk about the scientific consensus. 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     The overwhelming majority of climate scientists agree 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     that human activities, particularly the burning of fossil 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     fuels and deforestation, are causing the earth's 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     temperature to rise. It's not a debate, it's not a 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     theory, it's a fact. 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     But I guess you know better than the experts, right? You 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     know more than the thousands of scientists who have 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     dedicated their careers to studying the climate. You're 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     like a modern-day Galileo, bucking against the 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     established order and rejecting the evidence that's right 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     in front of you. 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     And what evidence is that, you ask? Well, let's start 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     with the basics. The earth's temperature has risen by 1.8 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     degrees Fahrenheit in the past century. That may not seem 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     like a lot, but it's a huge deal. It's the difference 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     between a stable climate and a chaotic one. It's the 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     difference between a livable planet and a hostile one. 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     But that's not all. The melting of polar ice caps, the 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     rising sea levels, the increasing frequency and severity 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     of extreme weather events, the shifts in seasons, the 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     changes in precipitation patterns â€“ it's all there, it's 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     all real, and it's all caused by human activity. 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     And yet, despite all of this, you still deny the reality 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     of climate change. You're like an ostrich, burying your 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     head in the sand and pretending that the problem will go 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     away if you ignore it long enough. 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     Well, let me tell you, it's not going away. Climate 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     change is the most pressing issue of our time, and it's 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     time for you to wake up and face the facts. The 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     scientific evidence is clear, the consequences are dire, 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     and it's time for you to stop being a denier and start 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     being a decent human being who cares about the planet and 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     its inhabitants. 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     So, listen up, climate change skeptic. I know you think 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     you know better, but you don't. You're wrong, you're 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     misinformed, and you're putting the entire planet at risk 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     with your ignorant beliefs. It's time to evolve, time to 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     learn, time to accept the reality of climate change.
