<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     okay to have questions and uncertainties about such a

     understand that this issue can be emotionally charged,

     Let's take a deep breath and start by looking at some of

     the evidence that supports the reality of climate change. 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     There are many scientific studies and data that show the

     Earth's temperature is rising, and the impact it's having

     increase in extreme weather events like hurricanes, 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">

     significant or that they're a natural part of the Earth's

<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     activities, such as burning fossil fuels and
