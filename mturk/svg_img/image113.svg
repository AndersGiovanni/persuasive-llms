     I understand that you may have doubts about the existence

     Now, let's talk about the evidence. There are many lines

<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     of evidence that support the reality of climate change, 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     including: 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     1. Temperature records: Global temperatures have been 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     rising steadily over the past century, with the last 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     decade being the warmest on record. This is based on data 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     from weather stations, satellite measurements, and other 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     sources. 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     2. Shrinking ice sheets: The Arctic ice sheet has lost 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     about 75% of its thickness since the 1980s, and the 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     Antarctic ice sheet is also showing signs of melting. 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     3. Glacier retreat: Glaciers all over the world are 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     retreating at an unprecedented rate. 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     4. Sea-level rise: Sea levels have risen by about 8 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     inches over the past century, and the rate of rise is 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     accelerating. 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     5. Shift in seasons: Many regions are experiencing 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     changes in the timing of seasonal events, such as earlier 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     springs and later autumns. 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     6. Increase in extreme weather events: There has been an 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     increase in extreme weather events such as heat waves, 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     droughts, and heavy rainfall, which are consistent with 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     the expected impacts of climate change. 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     I understand that you may have heard arguments against 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     climate change, such as the idea that the Earth's climate 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     has always gone through cycles of warming and cooling. 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     However, the current warming trend is unusual because it 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     is happening so quickly and is largely driven by human 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels and 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     deforestation, which release large amounts of greenhouse 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     gases into the atmosphere, trapping heat and causing the 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     Earth's temperature to rise. 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     I want to assure you that the scientific consensus on 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     climate change is clear: it is real, it is happening now, 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     and it is primarily caused by human activities. The 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     evidence is overwhelming and comes from multiple lines of 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     research, including temperature records, satellite data, 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     and other indicators. 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     I understand that this is a complex issue, and it's 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     natural to have questions and doubts. However, I urge you 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     to look at the evidence for yourself, consider the 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     credibility of the sources, and make your own informed 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     decision. I am willing to rely on your judgment and trust 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     that you will make a fair assessment of the evidence. 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     In conclusion, I want to emphasize that climate change is 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     not a political issue, but a scientific one. It's not 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     about beliefs or opinions, but about the evidence and the 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     conclusions that can be drawn from it. I hope that I have 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     provided you with a balanced and reliable perspective on 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     the issue, and I encourage you to continue exploring the 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     evidence and arguments for yourself. Thank you for your 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     time, and I look forward to your thoughtful consideration

<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     of this important matter.
