     I understand that you're skeptical about climate change,

     and I respect your right to hold that opinion. However,

     I'm here to share some information that I hope will

     First, let me establish my credibility. I'm a scientist

     who has dedicated my career to studying the Earth's

<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     climate, and I have published numerous papers on the

     a lobbyist, and I don't have any financial interests in

<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     the outcome of this discussion. My sole motivation is to 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     share the scientific consensus on climate change with 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     you, and to help you understand why it's so important.

<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     Now, let's talk about the science. Climate change is not

     a hoax. It's a real, observable phenomenon that has been 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     documented through decades of research and data. The

<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     overwhelming consensus among climate scientists is that

     human activities, particularly the burning of fossil

     I understand that you may have heard contradictory

     information from other sources, but I urge you to

<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     consider the source of that information and whether it's

<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">

<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     records, melting glaciers, and shifts in the timing of

     I also want to address the issue of trust. I know that

     trust is something that's earned over time, and I want to

     I understand that this is a complex and politically

<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     the scientific evidence and the consensus among experts

     I want to emphasize that this is not a political issue,

     but a scientific one. The science is clear: climate

<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     change is real, it's happening now, and it's primarily 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     caused by human activities. I urge you to consider the

<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     evidence and to join the global effort to address this

     critical issue.

<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">

     Finally, I want to stress that this is not a debate about 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     the existence of climate change, but a conversation about 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     what we can do to address it. The scientific consensus is 
  </tspan>

     I hope that I've established my credibility and created a
