     Now, let's talk about the evidence for climate change. 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     The reality is that the Earth's climate is warming, and 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     the impacts are already being felt. Glaciers are melting, 
  </tspan>

     sea levels are rising, and extreme weather events are

     It's important to note that climate change is not a

<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     consensus on climate change is clear: it's real, it's

     I also want to emphasize that addressing climate change
