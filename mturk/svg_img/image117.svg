  <tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     Thank you for sharing your concerns about climate change. 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     I understand that it can be a confusing and overwhelming 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     topic, and it's important to take a step back and look at 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     the evidence. 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     Firstly, let's acknowledge that climate change is a 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     complex issue that can be difficult to fully understand. 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     It's natural to have doubts and questions, and it's 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     important to approach the topic with an open mind. 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     I'd like to assure you that climate change is not a hoax. 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     It's a real and pressing issue that has been extensively 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     researched and documented by scientists and experts in 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     the field. The evidence is clear: human activities, such 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, are releasing 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     large amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     leading to a global increase in temperatures. 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     I understand that it can be challenging to accept such a

<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     monumental issue, especially when there are conflicting 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     views and opinions. However, I want to emphasize that the 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     scientific consensus is clear: climate change is real, 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     and it's happening now. 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     It's important to remember that we're not alone in this. 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     Climate change affects us all, and it's our collective 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     responsibility to take action. We can start by educating 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     ourselves, reducing our carbon footprint, and advocating 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     for policies that protect our planet.

<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">

     I want to assure you that you're not alone in your

     concerns. Many people have the same doubts and fears, and 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     it's okay to feel overwhelmed. But I also want to

     I understand that it can be difficult to accept the

     reality of climate change, especially when it seems like

     such a daunting and insurmountable problem. But I want to

<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     remind you that we have the power to make a difference.

<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     We can start by having open and honest conversations,

<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     like this one, and by taking small steps in our daily

     lives to reduce our impact on the environment.

     I want to offer you my support and encouragement on your
