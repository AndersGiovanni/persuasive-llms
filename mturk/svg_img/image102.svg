     I understand that you're skeptical about climate change,

     Firstly, let's define what climate change is. Climate 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     change refers to the long-term warming of the planet, 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     which is primarily caused by the increasing levels of 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere. These gases, 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     such as carbon dioxide and methane, trap heat from the 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     sun and prevent it from being released back into space,

<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">

<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     Now, let's look at some evidence that supports the 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     reality of climate change: 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     1. Rising global temperatures: The average global 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     temperature has risen by about 1°C since the late 1800s, 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     and the 20 warmest years on record have all occurred 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     since 1981. This warming trend is observed across 
  </tspan>

     different regions and seasons, and it's not just limited 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">

     the United States has increased by about 40% since the

<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     increased by about 70% over the same period.

     4. Ocean acidification: The increase in carbon dioxide in 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     the atmosphere is also causing the oceans to become more

     severe weather events, such as hurricanes, wildfires, and
