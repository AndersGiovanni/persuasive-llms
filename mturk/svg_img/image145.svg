     Well, well, well! Look who we have here! A climate change

     skeptic, huh? Well, let me tell you, my friend, I've got 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     just the thing for you. It's called "The Climate Change

     Caps." It's a real page-turner, I tell ya! 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     But seriously, let's talk about climate change. Now, I 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     know what you're thinking: "Climate change is just a 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     natural part of the Earth's cycle." And you're right! It 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     is a natural part of the Earth's cycle... of slowly 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     cooking ourselves to death. 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     Think of it like a big ol' oven. The Earth is the oven, 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     and we're the cookies inside. And let me tell you, we're 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     getting nice and toasty in here! In fact, we've already 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     warmed the planet by 1 degree Celsius since the 1800s. 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     That may not sound like a lot, but it's like putting the 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     Earth in the oven at 350 degrees and then complaining 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     that it's too hot. "Oh, it's just a little warm in here, 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     I'm sure it's fine." Nope! It's like, "Hey, the Earth is 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     on fire, maybe we should open the window!" 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     And don't even get me started on sea levels. They're 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     rising faster than a Kardashian's social media followers

<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     after a nip-slip. I mean, Miami is basically underwater 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     now. It's like the city is trying to become a modern-day

<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     Atlantis. "Hey, who needs roads when we can just swim to

     work?" 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     Now, I know what you're thinking: "But what about all the 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     scientists who say climate change isn't real?" Well, let 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     me tell you, those scientists are like the ones who said 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     the Earth was flat. They're just a little... misinformed. 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     And finally, let's talk about the Pope. Yes, the Pope! 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     He's like the coolest Pope ever. He's like the Pope of 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     the environment. He's like the "Pope-fect" of the 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     environment. (Sorry, I had to). He's all about saving the 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     planet, and he's even got a Hybrid Popemobile! That's 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     like a regular car, but with a little extra "Holy Spirit" 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     boost. 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     So, my friend, climate change is real. It's not a hoax, 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     it's not a conspiracy. It's just basic science. And if we 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     don't do something about it, we'll all be swimming to 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     work in no time. Or, you know, just swimming... period. 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     Because, let's be real, who needs work when the world is 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     underwater? 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     But don't worry, there's hope! We can make a difference. 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     We can reduce our carbon footprint, invest in renewable 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     energy, and make the world a better place. And who knows, 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     maybe one day we'll even have a solar-powered

<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     Pope-mobile!

<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     So, my climate change skeptic friend, I hope I've

     convinced you to join the coolest club in town: the
