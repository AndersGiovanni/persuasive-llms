     I understand that you may have doubts about the reality

     of climate change, but I assure you that it is not a 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     hoax. Climate change is a scientifically proven 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     phenomenon that has been studied extensively by 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     researchers and experts in various fields.

     Firstly, let's look at the evidence. The average global 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     temperature has risen by about 1Â°C since the late 1800s, 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     and the past few years have been the hottest on record. 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     This warming is not limited to the Earth's surface; it 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     has also been observed in the oceans, atmosphere, and 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     melting glaciers. The ice caps are melting at an alarming 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     rate, and sea levels have risen by about 20 cm since 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     1880. 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">

<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     The cause of climate change is largely due to human 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     and agriculture. These activities release large amounts 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat and cause the 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     Earth's temperature to rise, leading to global warming. 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">

<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     The effects of climate change are far-reaching and 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     devastating. Rising temperatures and changing weather 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     patterns lead to more frequent and intense natural 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     disasters such as hurricanes, droughts, and wildfires. 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     This, in turn, affects ecosystems, biodiversity, and 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     human societies. For example, warmer ocean temperatures 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     have led to coral bleaching, which has devastated coral 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     reefs and the marine life that depends on them. 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     Climate change also has significant impacts on human 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     health. Higher temperatures increase the spread of 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     diseases, while extreme weather events can lead to 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     injuries and fatalities. In addition, climate change 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     exacerbates air pollution, which is linked to various

<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">

<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     Furthermore, climate change has significant economic

<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     consequences. Rising sea levels threaten coastal 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     communities and infrastructure, while extreme weather 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     events cause damage to property and disrupt businesses.

<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     The cost of climate change is already being felt, and

<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     it's expected to worsen in the coming years.

<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     climate has always gone through cycles of change. While

     I also understand that there may be some who argue that

     the science is not settled, but I urge you to consider

<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     the overwhelming consensus among climate scientists. The
