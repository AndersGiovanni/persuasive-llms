     I understand that you're skeptical about climate change, 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     and I respect your right to hold that opinion. However, 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     I'd like to share some information with you that I hope 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     will change your mind. 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     First, let me establish my credibility. I am a scientist 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     who has dedicated my career to studying the Earth's 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     climate, and I have published numerous papers on this 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     topic in peer-reviewed journals. I am not a politician or 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     a lobbyist, and I have no financial interest in the 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     outcome of this debate. My sole motivation is to provide 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     accurate information and help people understand the 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     science behind climate change. 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     Now, let's talk about the evidence. Climate change is not 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     a theory; it is a fact. The Earth's temperature has been 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     rising steadily over the past century, and this warming 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     trend has been observed and documented by scientists all 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     over the world. The evidence is overwhelming and comes 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     from multiple lines of evidence, including temperature 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     records, melting glaciers, and shifts in the timing of 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     seasonal events. 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     One of the most compelling pieces of evidence is the 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     shrinking of the Arctic ice cap. In the 1980s, the Arctic 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     ice cap was roughly 7 million square kilometers in size. 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     Today, it's less than 4 million square kilometers. That's 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     a loss of over 40% of the Arctic ice cap in just a few 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     decades. 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     Another piece of evidence is the increase in extreme 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     weather events. Climate change is leading to more 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     frequent and intense heatwaves, droughts, and heavy 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     rainfall events. This is not just a statistical trend; 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     it's something that people are experiencing firsthand. 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     I understand that there are natural fluctuations in the 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     Earth's climate, but the current warming trend is not 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     part of that natural cycle. The only way to explain the 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     observed warming is to include the effects of human 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     activities, such as burning fossil fuels and 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     deforestation, which release large amounts of greenhouse 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     gases into the atmosphere, trapping heat and leading to 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     global warming. 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     I want to emphasize that I am not asking you to take my 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     word for it. I am asking you to look at the evidence 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     yourself and draw your own conclusions. I am confident 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     that if you examine the scientific evidence objectively, 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     you will come to the same conclusion as the overwhelming 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     majority of climate scientists: that climate change is 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     real, it's happening now, and it's primarily caused by 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     human activities. 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     I also want to emphasize that this is not a political 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     issue; it's a scientific one. I am not asking you to 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     believe me because I am a scientist. I am asking you to 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     believe the evidence. And I am willing to rely on your 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     judgment, because I trust that you are a reasonable

<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     person who is open to considering the facts. 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     Finally, I want to emphasize that this is not a debate 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     about the existence of climate change. The scientific 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     consensus is clear: climate change is real. The debate is 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     about what we do about it. We can choose to ignore the 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     evidence and continue down the path of business as usual, 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     or we can take action to reduce our greenhouse gas

     emissions and mitigate the worst impacts of climate

  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     I hope that I have provided you with enough information

<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     to convince you that climate change is real. I am happy

<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     to answer any questions you may have and provide further
