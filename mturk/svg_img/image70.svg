     Well, well, well! Look who we have here! A climate change

<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     skeptic, huh? Well, let me tell you, my friend, I've got 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     a few tricks up my sleeve that'll make you believe in 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     climate change faster than you can say "global warming." 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     First of all, let's talk about the melting ice caps. Now, 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     I know what you're thinking - "They're just ice, they'll 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     melt anyway." But think about it, my friend. If the ice 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     caps are melting at an alarming rate, that means 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     someone's been sneaking into the North Pole and stealing 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     all the ice cubes out of Santa's drink! That's right, I'm 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     talking about a conspiracy of epic proportions. You can't 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     deny the science, my friend! 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     And don't even get me started on the rising sea levels. I 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     mean, come on, have you seen the pictures of the polar 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     bears stranded on tiny icebergs? It's like they're trying 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     to escape the heat island effect in the Arctic! They're 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     not just "bear-ly" surviving, they're "paw-sitively" 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     adorable! But seriously, if we don't do something about 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     climate change, we'll be swimming with the fishes - and 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     not in a fun, "Finding Nemo" kind of way. 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     Now, I know you're probably thinking, "But what about all 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     those scientists who say climate change is a hoax?" Well, 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     let me tell you, my friend, those scientists are just 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     trying to "snow" you. They're probably the same ones who 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     said the earth was flat, and that the moon landing was 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     faked. I mean, have you seen the pictures of the earth 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     from space? It's round, baby! And if you don't believe 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     me, just ask the astronauts who went to the moon. They'll 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     tell you, it's not made of cheese - it's made of ice 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     cream! (Just kidding, it's not made of ice cream, but it 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     is round.) 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     But seriously, my friend, the science is clear. Climate 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     change is real, it's happening now, and we need to do 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     something about it. So, let's all do our part, reduce our 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     carbon footprint, and save the earth - before it's too 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     late. 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     And remember, my friend, denying climate change is like 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     denying the existence of unicorns. It's a myth, it's not 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     supported by science, and it's just plain silly. But hey, 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     if you still don't believe me, I've got a unicorn right 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     here who'd love to tell you all about the dangers of 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     climate change. His name's Steve, he's got a horn, and 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     he's ready to make some magic happen. 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     So, what do you say, my climate change skeptic friend? 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     Are you ready to join the fight against climate change 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     and save the earth? I know you are, because you're a 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     smart cookie, and you know that science is on our side.

<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
