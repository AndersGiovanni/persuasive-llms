     I understand that you may have doubts about the existence

<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     of climate change, and I respect your skepticism. As 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     someone who is committed to honesty, reliability, and 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     dependability, I want to assure you that my goal is not

<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     to persuade you to believe something that is not true. 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     Instead, I want to present the evidence and scientific

<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     consensus on climate change in a clear and trustworthy 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     manner, and I want to rely on your judgment to evaluate 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     the information I provide. 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">

<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     First, let's establish some common ground. We both know 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     that the Earth's climate has always gone through cycles 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     of change throughout history. However, the current 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     warming trend is happening at an unprecedented rate and 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     scale. The overwhelming majority of climate scientists 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     agree that human activities, particularly the burning of 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     fossil fuels and deforestation, are significantly 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     contributing to the increase in global temperatures. 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     I understand that there may be some uncertainty about the 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     severity and causes of climate change. However, the 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     scientific consensus is clear: climate change is real, 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     it's happening now, and it's primarily caused by human 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     activities. The evidence for this is based on decades of 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     research and data from multiple lines of evidence, 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     including temperature records, melting glaciers, and

<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     shifts in the timing of seasonal events.

<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">

     I want to emphasize that I'm not asking you to take my

     word for it. I'm asking you to consider the weight of 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     evidence and the scientific consensus. Climate change is 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     not a political issue, but a matter of scientific fact. 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     The scientific consensus is based on the same principles 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     of evidence-based reasoning that we use in many other 
  </tspan>

     fields, such as medicine, engineering, and physics.

     I also want to acknowledge that there are many dedicated

<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     scientists and researchers who have dedicated their

     careers to studying climate change. These are not

<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     politicians or activists, but experts who are committed

<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">

     scientists: that climate change is real, it's happening
