     Hello there! I understand that you may have some doubts 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     about climate change, and I'm here to help address your 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     concerns. Firstly, let me acknowledge that it's 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     completely normal to have questions and doubts about such 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     a complex issue. It's important to recognize that climate 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     change can be a difficult topic to wrap your head around, 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     and it's okay to feel overwhelmed or uncertain. 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     I want to assure you that climate change is not a hoax. 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     It's a real and pressing issue that has been extensively 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     researched and documented by scientists and experts in 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     the field. The evidence is overwhelming and indicates 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     that human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     deforestation, are significantly contributing to the 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">

<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     opinions and misinformation circulating. However, I want 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     to assure you that the scientific consensus is clear: 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     climate change is real, it's happening now, and it's 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     primarily caused by human activities. 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     I want to offer you support and companionship in this

<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
     uncertain, but know that you're not alone. Many people 
  </tspan>
<tspan x="10" dy="1.2em">
